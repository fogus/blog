As mentioned in [my previous post about "actually agile"](http://blog.fogus.me/2012/08/03/everyones-agile/), I recently talked with [Craig Andera](http://www.twitter.com/craigandera) for the [Think Relevance podcast](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/tags/podcast).  He and I talked about many topics of interest to the readers of my blog including agile development, simulation, [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com), [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org), Alan Kay and a few projects that have occupied my time lately.  Among them is a book that I've been working on[^now] with [Russ Olsen](http://blog.russolsen.com/) about the past, present and future of programming languages.  At the moment I'm referring to it as "100 Languages in 100 Weeks",[^7] but this is only a working title and in no way a final option.

I'll post more information about the book moving forward as it becomes more fully formed.

Wish me luck.

:F

[^now]: ~100 pages of first-draft material, some source code, and another ~50 pages of outline, hundreds of pages of notes and another ~20 pages of footnotes right now.

[^7]: And this working title does not indicate that we're writing a book like Bruce Tate's wonderful ["7 Languages in 7 Weeks"](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X/?tag=fogus-20).
