core.cache v0.6.2 Release Notes
===============================

core.cache is a Clojure contrib library providing the following features:

* An underlying `CacheProtocol` used as the base abstraction for implementing new synchronous caches

* A `defcache` macro for hooking your `CacheProtocol` implementations into the Clojure associative data capabilities.

* Immutable implementations of some basic caching strategies
  - First-in-first-out (FIFOCache)
  - Least-recently-used (LRUCache)
  - Least-used (LUCache)
  - Time-to-live (TTLCache)
  - Soft-Reference cache (SoftCache)
  - Naive cache (BasicCache)

* Implementation of an efficient buffer replacement policy based on the *low inter-reference recency set* algorithm (LIRSCache) described in the [LIRS](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.116.2184) paper

* Factory functions for each existing cache type

Absorb
------

You can use core.cache in your [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) and [Cake](https://github.com/flatland/cake) projects with the following `:dependencies` directive in your `project.clj` file:

    [org.clojure/core.cache "0.6.2"]

For Maven-driven projects, use the following slice of XML in your `pom.xml`'s `<dependencies>` section:

    <dependency>
	  <groupId>org.clojure</groupId>
	  <artifactId>core.cache</artifactId>
	  <version>0.6.2</version>
	</dependency>

Enjoy!

Changes from v0.6.1
-------------------

The v0.6.2 version of core.cache contains the following changes:

* Removed reflection warnings.

* Bug fix for LRU, LU and TTL caches disabling the eviction of duplicate keys prior to a threshold less than three.

* FIFOCache respects threshold prior to applying its eviction policy.

Plans
-----

The following capabilities are under design, development, or consideration for future versions of core.cache:

* More speed!
* Make ClojureScript compatible
* Asynchronous caching protocol
* FunCache implementation
* `LIRSCache evict`
* Hardening of the `seed` function implementations
* test.generative usage
* Deprecation of Clache
* More documentation and examples

More planning is needed around capabilities not listed nor thought of.
