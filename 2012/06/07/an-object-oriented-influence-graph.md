*this is a follow-on to the [functional programming influence graph](http://blog.fogus.me/2012/05/02/a-functional-programming-influence-graph) and these graphs are intended to connect.*

With the help of Twitter friends I developed a directed graph of traditionally (and bolted-on) object-oriented programming languages and their influences on one another.  The latest version is as follows:

*note: Ovals represent languages, hexagons are "ideas", and blue boxes represent language families. This is not meant to be comprehensive at the leaves, but I would like it to be so at the inner nodes and roots.*

Take a look and let me know what you think. The graph is not entirely complete, but the main connections are in place. Suggestions welcomed -- including (and preferably with) references. I will update the [source](https://gist.github.com/2883931) and graph periodically.
