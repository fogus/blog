With the help of Twitter friends[^tw] I developed a directed graph of traditionally functional programming languages and their influences on one another.  The latest version is as follows:

[^tw]: This has been my most positive Twitter experience by far.

*note: Ovals represent languages, hexagons are "ideas", and blue boxes represent language families represented by an ideal implementation. This is not meant to be comprehensive at the leaves, but I would like it to be so at the inner nodes and roots.*

Take a look and let me know what you think. The graph is not entirely complete, but the main connections are in place. Suggestions welcomed -- including (and preferably with) references. I will update the [source](https://gist.github.com/2576547) and graph periodically.
