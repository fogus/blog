I rarely declare new year resolutions but for some reason I felt oddly compelled to do so this year (2012). These were formulated in the beginning of the year, but here they are for posterity's sake:

* Read 52 books ([done](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/266149-michael?format=html&shelf=2012_read))
* Listen to [everything Béla Bartók ever composed](http://www.amazon.com/Bartok-Complete-Edition-Gyorgy-Melis/dp/B00004YLIJ/?tag=fogus-20) ([done](http://www.last.fm/user/fojure/library/music/B%C3%A9la+Bart%C3%B3k?sortOrder=desc&sortBy=plays))
* Create a programming language
* [Commit to open source](http://github.com/fogus) at least 350 days
* 経行
* [Deliver a training course](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/)
