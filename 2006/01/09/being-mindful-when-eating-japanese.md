<p><em>Never grab food from another person&#8217;s chop-sticks using your own chop-sticks</em><br />
There is a custom at Japanese funerals where the bones of the deceased are passed from one person to the next using chop-sticks and then finally being placed into the urn. Passing food from chop-stick to chop-stick is viewed to be in bad taste.</p>
<p><em>Never &#8216;plant&#8217; your chop-sticks into your bowl of rice (i.e. so that it looks like rabbit ears)</em><br />

Again, this harkens back to a Japanese tradition where food is often offered to the ancestors and placed into the rice like so.</p>
<p><em>One bite!</em><br />
Sushi, when eaten with either hands or chop-sticks, should be consumed with one bite. Never nibble. One bite! Hikeeba! If the futomaki is too big for your mouth, then do not order it.</p>
<p><em>Too much soy sauce, a baka gaijin makes.</em><br />
I still struggle with this one. When eating sushi, one should be careful not to place a standing puddle of soy sauce in the bottom of your given dish. Instead the amount shold be somewhere between a one-atom-thickness stain on the dish itself and the aforementioned puddle (closer to the former).</p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t destroy your rice</em><br />
Japanese rice is made to be sticky. This makes it perfect for eating with chop-sticks. However, it is considered bad form to let your rice soak up so much soy sauce that it looses the very property that makes it loved.</p>
