<p>It&#8217;s very simple.  I&#8217;m listening to a book on my iPod during the train ride to work when I pull up to my specific stop.  I push and hold a given button for a few seconds which sets a bookmark at that location in that file.  I then proceed to work and listen to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigur_Ros">my</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_%28band%29">favorite</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boards_Of_Canada">hacking</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_%28band%29">music</a> for my time there and once again return to the train.  I then navigate to a bookmarks menu and select the book that I had been listening to earlier in the day thus picking up right where I left off.</p>

	<p>Is that so hard?</p>
