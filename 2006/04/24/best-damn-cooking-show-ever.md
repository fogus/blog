<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to do anything recently except discover the best damn cooking show ever&#8230; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Floyd">Floyd</a> on Italy. This guy is my new idol. He is an outspoken brit who likes to get drunk during his shows, spills things, makes fun of himself, and ridicules his onlookers. What more can you ask for?</p>
