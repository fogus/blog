<p>Well, <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/jag/">James Gosling</a> didn't tag me, but I'm going to try and start my own branch â€” so here now are 5 things about me that you didn't know:</p>
<ol>
<li>I severed the tip of my left ring-finger in a horrible washing machine motor accident and it was successfully re-attached.  I no longer have feeling in that finger however.</li>
<li>I worked exactly 10 hours at Friendly's restaurant in Severna Park MD prior to going to college.  I walked out after being called stupid by the assistant manager.  </li>

<li>... I then worked at a car wash in Annapolis as a cashier.  That specific location hired mostly men on work release from the local prison and I learned many lessons from that crowd.  For example, did you know that you can smoke crack using only a combination lock?  One day I casually mentioned to one of the guys that the vending machine could be thwarted by attaching tape to a dollar bill and pulling it out of the feeder after receiving credit.  The next day the machine was empty.</li>
<li>My first computing job was with Veridian Systems in California, MD writing the operating system for their PCI Bit-Sync.  This was when I was still in college at SMCM</li>
<li>My first Objective C project was an <a target="_blank" href="http://newark.pardey.org/book/cryptonomicon/slide61.html">Ordo-</a>mode plugin to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I now tag <a target="_blank" href="http://m00se.wordpress.com/">Sarah</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://damnthatscool.com/">Ben</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaldistortion.org/">Shawn</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.modus-tollens.com">Yuki</a>.  </p>
