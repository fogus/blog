I have been monkeying around with a Lisp interpreter written in Python for a few weeks whenever I have a few spare cycles and I am proud to say that the initial v0.0.1 release is ready fro mass consumption.  Granted, it only performs the four basic arithmetic functions and the print function (although the latter throws a nasty exception after succeeding).  The binary targets OSX and can be executed via the Terminal with the command:<br/>
<pre><code>open &lt;saved location&gt;/lithp.app/Contents/MacOS/lithp
</code></pre>
This is an utterly useless program for all but myself.  Enjoy?<br/>
