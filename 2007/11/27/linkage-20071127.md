<blockquote>The code works as expected in Bochs  (though I treat it as a hard disk image).  I have made the assumption that USB keys are treated like hard disks.  That is, it loads the first sector of the device and checks the boot sig, etc.</blockquote>

I had a subscription for the past two years, but I probably will not continue due to lack of time.  The stories were pretty good however, and I would probably buy a collection if'n one existed.<br/>

<blockquote>While creating the 2nd presentation, I found a couple things that surprised me. The first is how popular Flex is - not only in job listings, but also in skilled developers and mailing list traffic. Below is a graph that shows how there aren't many jobs for most of the frameworks, but there's lots for Flex.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As I work with teams of programmers in the field, I'm consistently struck by the yawning abyss between that 20% and the rest of the world. It makes the divide between the open-source and Microsoft camps look like a shallow ditch.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Developers who actively seek to apply patterns to every coding problem are adding unnecessary complexity. Far from being something you look to add to your code, you should feel bad every time you are forced to code up another design pattern, it means you are doing busy work that makes things more complex and is of dubious benefit. But hey, your code has design patterns, and no one can take that from you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>OK, people often find it most convenient to do State using “Monads”. I think I'm going to leave that for now, and just thread state explicitly. Mainly because I haven't yet got around to learning how to use the State Monad. Hopefully this will eventually become annoying enough that it will give me impetus to learn the monadic version.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It’s sad, the way things turned out for Be. Having been involved in several other “great technology meets questionable corporate practice and/or harsh market conditions” situations in the last ~8 years or so, this isn’t a shock. But even though I wasn’t actually working for Be, several of my friends were, and as well, this was the technology that should have had a chance.</blockquote> (plus see his <a href="http://www.thule.no/haynie/">archives</a>)<br/>
