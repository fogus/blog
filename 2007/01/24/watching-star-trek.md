<p>I'm working my way through the Star Trek Original Series season 1 discs, and I have a few questions:</p>
<p><strong>This Side of Paradise</strong></p>
<p>If the human woman loves Spock so much, then why does she keep calling him "Mr. Spock"?</p>
<p><strong>Devil in the Dark</strong></p>
<p>- Spock takes the time to caculate the probability that he and Kirk will be killed, yet they insists on spending all of their time together, thus hurting their chances for survival.</p>

<p>- If the creature's hide is so corrosive, then why do Spock and Kirk just pick up pieces of it with their bare hands?</p>
<p>- "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!"???</p>
<p>- Dammit!  Will you just go into the tunnel already?!?</p>
<p><strong>The Alternative Factor</strong></p>
<p>You know, the Federation could save themselves a lot of trouble if they build some safeguards into their transporters.</p>
