<blockquote>In a pinch, which is where they usually were, our heroes could be counted on to come up with a complete scientific theory, invent the technology to implement it, build the tools to implement the technology, and produce the (usually) weapons to blow away the baddies, all while being chased in their spaceship hither and thither through the trackless wastes of the galaxy (he wrote like that) by assorted Fenachrone, Boskonians, and the World Steel Corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There are ten real currently-maintained implementations. I judged this by seeing which implementations were currently being supported by prominent libraries and tools, by seeing whether there was active mail/news/etc. traffic about the implementation, by searching the web and asking around. Obviously this was something of a judgement call on my part. If I omitted any, it was certainly not on purpose.</blockquote>
