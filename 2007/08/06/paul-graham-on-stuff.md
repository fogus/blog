<em>Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven't changed correspondingly.</em><br/>
<em>Their house isn't theirs; it's their stuff's.</em><br/>
<span style="font-style:italic;">A cluttered room is literally exhausting.</span><br/>
<span style="font-style:italic;">The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don't use much because it's too good.</span><br/>
<span style="font-style:italic;">Stuff used to be valuable, and now it's not.</span><br/>
