<b>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</b> (0060745908)
<p>Started well.  Interesting ending.  Middle... yawn.</p>

<b>The Burning World</b> (B0007EDC5E)
<p>Not too bad.  Should probably read it again.</p>

<b>The Silmarillion</b> (0345325818)
<p>Liked the LOTR trilogy better, but this is not too bad if you can manage the 405 different characters.</p>

<b>Foundation</b> (0553803719)
<p>Should have read this 15 years ago.  Great.</p>

<b>The Brief History of the Dead</b> (0375423699)
<p>Not too bad if you do not mind convolution, bland characters, and that WTF feeling at the end.</p>

<b>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</b> (0142000280)
<p>Not a bad system... with slight modification.</p>

<b>Dreaming in Code</b> (1400082463)
<p>Pretty accurate description of a software project.</p>

<b>Dark Shadows</b> (B000BLI0EQ)
<p>It's Dark Shadows... what do you expect?</p>

<b>Victoria Winters</b> (B000EIU9BI)
<p>Same plot as the one before this.</p>
