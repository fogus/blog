Great blog posts read
---------------------

* *[1,000 True Fans](http://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)* - an interesting look into a certain aspect of the [long-tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail#Business) (something I've been mulling over lately WRT lang and game dev).

* *[The Architecture of the Burroughs B5000](http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burroughs%20B-5000.htm)* - The computer architecture that could/should have been the basis for today's offerings?
* *[God's Lonely Programmer](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/gods-lonely-programmer)* - At one point I was obsessed with OS kernel development.  Naturally my studies and explorations led me to [LoseThos](http://web.archive.org/web/20060702135534/http://www.losethos.com/), an eccentric OS designed and developed by an eccentric programmer named Terry Davis.  This is his story.

This article has really changed my perspective around open-source.
* *[Smalltalk MVC Translated to JavaScript](http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/smalltalk-mvc-translated-to-javascript)* - OOP is not as fashionable as it used to be, but that's not to say that dissecting it isn't instructive.

Most viewed blog posts by me
----------------------------

I've been scaling back on blogging this past year and have tried something different instead - [Read-Eval-Print-λove](http://www.readevalprintlove.org).  That said, there were a couple of high-traffic posts on my blog.

* [The 100:10:1 method: my approach to open source](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/11/04/the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source/) - wherein I describe how my focus on open-source development has shifted from high-volume to a focus on real value and (hopefully) higher quality.
* [Six works of computer science-fiction](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/04/27/six-works-of-computer-science-fiction/) - Six books about computing systems that couldn't possibly exist, but do/did.
* [Inspirational technical books that are not technical](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/07/07/inspirational-technical-books-that-are-not-technical/) - Non-technical books about code, systems, or people that motivate me to write code.
* [Palindromic sequences in Clojure](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/04/13/palindromic-sequences-in-clojure/) - Playing around with palindromes in [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org).

Favorite technical books discovered (and read)
----------------------------------------------

I've intentionally reduced the number of technical books that I consume lately, but there are a few that I "found" in 2015 that are stellar.

* *[The New Media Reader](http://www.amazon.com/New-Media-Reader-Noah-Wardrip-Fruin/dp/0262232278/?tag=fogus-20)* edited by Nick Montfort - If you're interested in the ideas put forth by the likes of Alan Kay or [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/) then this book provides a sliver of their minds.
* *[Tools for Thought](http://www.amazon.com/Tools-Thought-History-Mind-Expanding-Technology/dp/0139251081/?tag=fogus-20)* - Ditto
* *[Bitcoin for the Befuddled](http://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Befuddled-Conrad-Barski/dp/1593275730/?tag=fogus-20)* - Another triumph for [Conrad Barski](https://twitter.com/lisperati)!
* *[Handbook of LISP functions](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/mblisp/Handbook_of_LISP_Functions.pdf)* - an early junk-drawer software library — fully documented.

Favorite non-technical books read
---------------------------------

* *[Blues People](http://www.amazon.com/Blues-People-Experience-America-Developed/dp/B000LF5VPS/?tag=fogus-20)* - the story of the blues and the circumstances and people that led to it.

(thanks for the recommendation [Sam](https://twitter.com/samaaron)!)
* *[The Glass Bead Game](http://www.amazon.com/Glass-Bead-Game-Magister-Novel/dp/0312278497/?tag=fogus-20)* - if, like me, you  only liked the Mathic parts of [Anathem](http://www.amazon.com/Anathem-Neal-Stephenson/dp/006147410X/?tag=fogus-20) then you might like this gem.
* *[Between the World and Me](http://www.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0812993543/?tag=fogus-20)* - having grown up within a very different context, but in the same city and at the same age as Mr. Coates, this book was eye-opening.
