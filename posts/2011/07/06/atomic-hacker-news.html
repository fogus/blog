<p>Here’s the thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hacker News has not changed. I have.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a long-time member of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker
News</a> it appears that the relative quality and lack-thereof for the
link submissions, questions, and commentary has remained stable. There
are still very few links of interest to me, but those that are good tend
toward great. However, I find myself increasingly frustrated by the
signal to noise ratio of its commentary. However, after reflection it’s
not obvious that the content of the commentary has changed markedly
since my first day. The problem lies with me. That is, after <a
href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fogus">3.5 years</a> of
reading said commentary I’ve developed an uncanny ability to predict the
form of almost any comment thread based on the content of the link under
discussion.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This is a gross generalization of course, but as one without much
time to spare these days it’s the generalizations that drive my adaptive
behavior. That is, while Hacker News in general has become wholly
predictable, at the level of the strongest individual contributors it’s
as vibrant as ever – perhaps moreso. A killer service named <a
href="http://hackerfollow.com/">Hacker Follow</a> has allowed me to
cherry-pick those commentators who’ve won my heart (so to speak) and I
have to admit that I’ve not missed a thing.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>One lesson that I’ve learned in my time on the Internet is especially
relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great commentators transcend context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This therefore leads into yet another lesson to embrace moving
forward:</p>
<p>Hacker News is a community.</p>
<p>Communities become predictable.</p>
<p>Individuals are where it’s at.</p>
