<h1 id="why-no-eval">Why no eval?</h1>
<p><em>this is the second entry in an n-part <a

<p>I was not expecting to talk about <code>eval</code> so soon in this
series, but apparently its exclusion from <a
href="http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> was
more controversial than I imagined. However, by excluding
<code>eval</code> the Clojure/core team was not acting miserly, but
instead had valid reasons for its exclusion. This post will go over why
<code>eval</code> was excluded and why it may never see the light of day
in the core distribution.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-eval">What is <code>eval</code>?</h2>
<p>The first question you may have is “who cares?” but preceding that
may be “what is eval?” Simply put, <code>eval</code> is a function that
takes a data structure representing a program and executes it in the
context of the dynamic environment. For example, in Clojure you can
perform the follow:</p>
<pre><code>(eval &#39;(+ 1 2 3))
;=&gt; 6</code></pre>
<p>This takes the list: the symbol <code>+</code> and the numbers
<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code> and executes it as if
it was typed into the REPL. Let’s look at a more interesting
example:</p>
<pre><code>(def blip [\b \e \e \p])
(def buzz {:beep 42})

(eval (list* (keyword (reduce str blip)) 
             [(symbol &quot;buzz&quot;)]))

;=&gt; 42</code></pre>
<p>This fragment builds from pieces the list <code>(:beep buzz)</code>
which is evaluated as a keyword lookup into a map. This is an
interesting example not because the result is useful, but in that it
demonstrates an interesting property of Clojure (and Lisp in general) –
code is made of the same data structures that the language itself
manipulates.</p>
<h2 id="eval-is-indeed-very-cool">eval is Indeed Very Cool</h2>
<p>One of the first games that programmers new to Lisp play is the
<code>eval</code> game. That is, they build a bunch of data structures
using the Lisp functions and pass them into <code>eval</code>. It’s
great fun. Having <code>eval</code> in ClojureScript would also be a
very useful tool. Indeed, I suspect it would be extremely useful to base
an in-page REPL on <code>eval</code>. This REPL could then be made to
operate within the context of the currently loaded ClojureScript-enabled
page allowing direct manipulation of the page elements and even the
runtime code itself. This is potentially a very powerful debugging and
incremental development tool for ClojureScript in the same way that <a
href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> serves for JavaScript.
However, the greatest part about this “fictional” REPL is that <a
href="https://github.com/ibdknox/brepl">it doesn’t require that
ClojureScript provide <code>eval</code> <strong>at all</strong></a>.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But honestly, if ClojureScript programs are composed of data forms
directly manipulable by the language itself then why not just provide
<code>eval</code> anyway? The answer can be found, as many answers in
life, in the tradeoffs.</p>
<h2 id="fojurescript">FojureScript</h2>
<p>Imagine a language named FojureScript that is exactly like
ClojureScript in every way except that it contains <code>eval</code>
(and has awesome error messages). FojureScript programs are compiled
into JavaScript with a compiler written in another language named
Fojure. FojureScript’s compiler also allows for <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/07/21/compiling-clojure-to-javascript-pt1/">differing
levels of optimization</a> from raw JavaScript emission, to advanced
dead-code elimination. What happens when a call to <code>eval</code> is
performed in FojureScript? In the first scenario the naive
<code>eval</code> falls down:</p>
<pre><code>(eval &#39;(+ 1 2 3))
;!! Unknown function +.
;!! Maybe you meant fojs.bore._PLUS_?</code></pre>
<p>So clearly the problem is that during the compilation process the
function named by <code>+</code> is munged into a JavaScript function
<code>fojs.bore._PLUS_</code>. OK, no big deal. FojureScript can be made
to resolve the properly munged names at evaluation time with
(relatively) minimal fuss. However, what about the call to
<code>eval</code> in the case of a maximally minified compilation?</p>
<pre><code>(eval &#39;(+ 1 2 3))
;!! WTF dude!?  I have no idea what + is!
:!! That function doesn&#39;t even exist.</code></pre>
<p>What’s the problem?</p>
<p>If you looked in the FojureScript bore.fojs library you would see
that <code>+</code> is clearly defined. However, in the production code
a call to <code>+</code> never actually occured and therefore its
implementation was removed completely from the runtime environment!</p>
<h2 id="blurring-the-lines">Blurring the Lines</h2>
<p>Although Lisp programs are made up of data structures available in
the language, there is a marked difference between the data composing
the code, and the data flowing through the code. The data composing the
language is subject to static analysis and a lot of information about it
can be garnered at the time of compilation. The data running through the
code is known only at the time of execution and therefore can only be
known in very superficial ways. There is a stark line between what is
known at compilation time and what is known at runtime. Therefore,
compilation can and will eventually remove a function that is needed at
runtime via <code>eval</code>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> And therein lies the
rub. The presence of <code>eval</code> blurs the line between runtime
and compilation time requiring that everything available in the latter
be present in the former. <em>(or is it the other way around?)</em></p>
<h2 id="trade-off">Trade-off</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Rationale">A
goal</a> of the ClojureScript team is to provide maximally minified
source code that maintains program semantics. The trade-off therefore is
that it is much more important as a ClojureScript design principle that
the runtime environment be available at dev time than the dev
environment be available at runtime.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The larger goal of Clojure (the family) is to generate
high-performance code on <em>every single platform</em> and to support
<code>eval</code> in ClojureScript is antithetical to that goal. It
would be a fool’s errand to try and support <code>eval</code> in the
face of aggressive code elimination – you can have one, but not the
other. ClojureScript is designed to solve the types of big problems that
are simply too difficult to fathom, much less achieve, using raw
JavaScript or any number of JavaScript frameworks. It’s conceivable that
these huge applications will require a bevy of libraries. You cannot
effectively leverage these libraries without an optimizing compiler
utilizing dead-code elimination. You cannot have the optimizing compiler
if you wish to support <code>eval</code>. <em>Q.E.D.</em></p>
<p>While you may not agree with all decisions made in the development of
ClojureScript (especially regarding <code>eval</code>), I hope you will
agree that it was not designed and developed by fools.</p>
