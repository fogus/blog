<p>When <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> came on the scene I
was excited by the prospect of a questions site that might prove useful.
However, after spending some time exploring the site I simply couldn’t
find the motivation to stay. I would return from time to time to see
what had changed and noticed that the populated data seemed to grow at
an incredible rate. However, I just didn’t get what all the fuss was
about. Part of the problem was that I was never able to garner valuable
information in the sea of data. Quora it seems posses the same
characteristic as the class of wikis and black holes; that is, data goes
in, but information never escapes. However, I recently returned after
following a Clojure-related link regarding the rise of functional
programming or some such topic and it was then that the appeal of Quora
finally dawned on me.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/opinion.jpeg"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/opinion-300x240.jpg" alt="" title="opinion" width="300" height="240" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3349" /></a>
&gt; People LOVE to give their opinion.</p>
<p>In hindsight the realization seems obvious and I must be more dense
than I ever imagined to have missed it. Alas, here it is - the secret of
Quora. Sadly, I am not sure that this bodes well for Quora. Granted it
is a beautiful site and its idea of community classification seems
strong, but as a <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/02/28/the-keepers-of-answers/">keeper of
opinions</a> I fear Quora’s days are numbered. When viewed under this
lens it seems obvious what drove the early growth. That is, in the
beginning Quora was a vast frontier of unsullied questions awaiting
opinion – a virtual pontificator’s nirvana. However, this state can only
maintain as long as there are opinions to be provided. Granted the
Internet is a veritable cornucopia of opinion, but this is part of the
problem. Quora’s competitor is any pretty site willing to provide yet
another untainted garden for others’ to plant their sentiments.<a
