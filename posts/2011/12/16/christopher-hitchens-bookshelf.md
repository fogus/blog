As you may already know, [Christopher Hitchens passed away today](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/12/In-Memoriam-Christopher-Hitchens-19492011).  Among his many attributes, I most admired his love of the written form.  Over the years I've built [a list of books recommended and written by Hitchens](http://fogus.me/static/hitch/) and while I've yet to read even a third, the eventual goal is to read them all.  Of those I've read from his list, my favorites include:

* [*The Plague* by Camus](http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0679720219?tag=fogus-20)
* [*The Name of the Rose* by Umberto Eco](http://www.amazon.com/Name-Rose-including-Authors-Postscript/dp/0156001314?tag=fogus-20)
* [*Catch-22* by Joseph Heller](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0684833395?tag=fogus-20)
* [*Einstein: His Life and Universe* by Walter Isaacson](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743264738?tag=fogus-20)
* [*The Jungle* by Upton Sinclair](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1884365302?tag=fogus-20)
* [*The Code of the Woosters* by P.G. Wodehouse](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1841591009?tag=fogus-20)
* [*The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche* by H.L. Mencken](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q9SFMG?tag=fogus-20)

There are ~190 additional titles to explore on the current list.  Regardless of your feelings on Hitchens' anti-theism, his literary tastes were eclectic so there should be much to love in the full listing.  It's sad to think that it's not likely that this list will substantially grow -- save for the occasional correction of omissions.

Thank you Mr. Hitchens.
