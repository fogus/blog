Great things and people that I discovered, learned, read, met, etc. in 2011.  No particular ordering is implied.  Not everything is new.


Great blog posts read
---------------------

* [Xv6: Unix v6 Ported to ANSI C, x86](http://os-blog.com/xv6-unix-v6-ported-to-ansi-c-x86/) -- *in fact, the [OS Blog](http://os-blog.com/) is one of my favorite new blogs.*

* [Category theory for the Java programmer](http://reperiendi.wordpress.com/2007/11/03/category-theory-for-the-java-programmer/) -- *a fairly nice take on the subject.*

* [A brief overview of the Clojure web stack](http://brehaut.net/blog/2011/ring_introduction) -- *my notes taken at the time are prefaced with WJW.*

* [To Dissect a Mockingbird: A Graphical Notation for the Lambda Calculus with Animated Reduction](http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/index.htm) -- *I came to this post ~10 years late, but boy was it worth the wait.*

* [Itsy-OS Kernel: Preemptive Switcher & Memory Manager](http://www.retroprogramming.com/2011/03/itsy-os-simple-preemptive-switcher.html) -- *I am a complete sucker for this kind of post.  I played with the idea of an OSDev blog like no other, but never got past the outline stage... one day.*

* [Monads are not metaphors](http://www.codecommit.com/blog/ruby/monads-are-not-metaphors) -- *Daniel with the 1,000,000th post on monads actually covers fresh ground!*

* [Minimally awesome TODOs](http://blog.jerodsanto.net/2010/12/minimally-awesome-todos/) -- *a 2010 post that I didn't read until much later.  Lifehack posts tend to bore me, but this one is oddly compelling*
