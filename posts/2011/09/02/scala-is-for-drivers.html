<p><em>this post inspired by Volkswagen’s excellent marketing campaign
‘Drivers Wanted’</em></p>
<p>An unfortunate meme<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> dogging Scala is the notion that it
is <a href="#link-removed">a notoriously complicated language</a>. For
better or worse, I do believe that the lion-share of this general
perception is fueled by both fear and lack of familiarity. That’s not to
say that Scala doesn’t have its share of complexities, instead the
fearful perception doesn’t map to the realities of the language
experienced after consistent usage. Having said all of that, I think
it’s important to note that Scala is designed to solve very hard
problems and because of this there is a definite set of highly abstract
ideas that, if one is unfamiliar with it or languages like it, possess a
very sharp learning curve. However, an important point to ponder
regarding learning curves is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The complexity of a language cannot be defined solely in terms of the
pain felt in the initial stages of learning.</p>
<p>– me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s try to attach a picture to this idea.</p>
<h1 id="scalas-cliff-of-insanity">Scala’s cliff of insanity</h1>
<p>If someone (me again) familiar with both Scala and Java were to
describe the complexity curve of the <em>former</em> it might look
something like this:</p>

<p>A description of this image could be described as such:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The initial smoothness is indicative of a simple, low-ceremony
<code>"Hello World"</code> example and the fact that it is super-easy to
write Java-flavored Scala</li>
<li>The massive spike is indicative of the reality that Scala is a very
powerful language chock full of powerful abstractions, syntactic
flexibilities, and paradigm-ness<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>Eventually one comes to learn how the powerful features can be
properly used and how robust and maintainable Scala code is
constructed</li>
<li>However, another spike hits when one learns that the powerful
abstractions are <a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz">building
blocks for even more powerful abstractions</a></li>
<li>Eventually, the complexities of the language itself become second
nature, make sense in the context of the whole, and stay out of the
way,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> leaving one to concentrate on the
problems at hand</li>
</ol>
<p>This complexity curve is indicative of the most powerful programming
languages.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="javas-cliff-of-inanity">Java’s cliff of inanity</h1>
<p>If someone familiar with both Scala and Java were to describe the
complexity curve of the <em>latter</em> it might look something like
this:</p>
<figure>
<img
src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/java-complexity.png"
title="The Cliff of inanity" alt="java-cliff" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">java-cliff</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A description of this image could be described as such:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The initial smoothness is indicative of a simple, but ceremonious
<code>"Hello World"</code> example and the fact that Java is designed
for ease of introduction <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
<li>The moderate spike is indicative of the reality that good
object-oriented programming is hard</li>
<li>However, while the complexity curve’s slope decreases, it continues
to climb. The reason for this is that Java is chock full of incidental
complexities, language foibles, and type system inconsistencies</li>
<li>Alas with the help of powerful IDEs, one can eventually come to
gripes with the foibles. However, the language never gets out of your
way. There is a definite, <a
href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/language-trickery-and-ejb">tangible
limit to the abstractions provided by Java</a> and these limitations
constantly impose additional complexities on the already complex
problems one is trying to solve</li>
</ol>
<p>This complexity curve is indicative of <a

<h1 id="cars">Cars</h1>
<p>I can’t stand cars. Nothing is more boring to me than car talk. I
like a car that will get me from here to there with reasonable fuel
efficiency and safety. That’s it. I can appreciate the beauty and power
of an Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione, but it doesn’t serve my current
needs.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/car-300x220.jpg" alt="The height of enterprise offerings" title="car" width="300" height="220" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3545" /></p>
<p>However, if I ever have the need for a fast get-away<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
then my car will fight me at higher-speeds and then eventually simply
break-down. Clearly my car is not designed to meet the needs of a
fast-paced environment and because I’ve never had such a need neither am
I.</p>
<p>Scala is an Alfa Romeo.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>That’s not to say that there is no room for improvement
in Scala’s handling of powerful abstractions. For example, the hoops
required to facilitate the use of <a
href="http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2010/06/scala-implicits-type-classes-here-i.html">type
classes</a> in Scala are extremely cumbersome. Scala would be better
served by a first-class syntactic treatment of type classes, but I alas
I have not thought this through to its logical end and am ready to be
convinced otherwise.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Some of these powerful programming languages are found
in my blog post about <a

Languages</a>.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>A alternative, but wholly inflammatory way to describe
this post can also be stated as: Scala helps programmers solve hard
programming problems - Java helps human resources solve staffing
problems. But I thought this might be a little over the top. Funny yes,
but definitely over the top.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn6"><p>No one expects the zombie apocalypse.<a href="#fnref6"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>However, there is a lot of effort spent on the matter of
Scala’s perception of complexity. I’m of the opinion that those involved
in its development and marketing should just step back and say “Yeah. So
what? So is Spring. Programming is hard and only set to get harder and
Scala can help you meet these growing complexities.” Any time spent on
the development of Scala that does not directly benefit “drivers” is
time wasted IMO.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
