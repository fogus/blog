While reflecting on the virtue of learning multiple programming languages, each instantiating different paradigms, I came to the conclusion that there is value in feeling out of sorts.  Conflict in oneself and against the forces of confusion is essential for advancing one's technical skills and learning humility in the face of seemingly insurmountable complexities.  

Learning another language is great.  Learning another ten is better.  Learning a paradigm is superb.  Learning another dozen is sublime.  Dynamic?  Static?  Phooey!  

Never become comfortable.

Never feel safe.

:F
