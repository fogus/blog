<p>There has been <a
href="http://arcanesentiment.blogspot.com/2011/04/clojure-is-almost-as-big-as-common-lisp.html">some
talk about the number of forms available in Clojure compared to Common
Lisp</a>. I find this line of thought puzzling. This is the same line of
thinking that has been thrown at Common Lisp for ages – and the argument
grows no more valid over time.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The only reason that we
can have such a discussion is because forms and functions in Common Lisp
and Clojure are countable in the first place. How do you measure the
size of a language’s conceptual model? Is the Var or the function the
right currency with which to tally language size? If so, then how many
Vars are Java’s checked exceptions worth?</p>
<p><a href="http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/">A well-formed Forth
program consists of hundreds of special-purpose words</a>, but no one
would say that Forth is a bloated language. Instead, it’s important to
know that a language should always have the right number of forms and
functions to be properly expressive. Should Clojure eliminate useful
functions for the sake of Var count? Who pays the bill in that case?
Well, of course, the Clojure programmer does.

It’s simple to write many of Clojure’s core functions, so why do we need
most of them? We can instead force the programmer to write and re-write
common functions over and over again. This is a Scheme perspective.
Clojure is not Scheme.</p>
<p>Any function, form, or Var in Clojure’s distribution is there for two
reasons: 1) it is useful and 2) it provides abstraction.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Rich is very thoughtful<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> in including or excluding new
features into the language. In the war between practicality and purity
in Clojure’s offerings, it’s the former that wins.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Clojure has <em>the right number of Vars</em>™ to provide an
expressive programming experience. No less.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I’ve often found that people rallying against Common
Lisp’s “bloat” fail (or refuse) to recognize that the language was
designed to allow the programmer to do <em>anything</em> not simply the
<em>right</em> thing (as defined by the language designers). It’s doubly
perplexing when <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=374">advocates of
Common Lisp, who should know better</a>, point their gnarled fingers at
Clojure’s supposed “bloat”.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>Abstraction takes the typical cognitive form that we’re
all familiar with, but it also helps to abstract performance
characteristics. This distinction is the subject of another post. ;-)<a

Clojure strives for.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
