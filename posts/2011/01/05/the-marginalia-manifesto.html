<h2 id="the-importance-of-documentation">The importance of
documentation</h2>
<p>In late 2010 I was motivated by posts by <a
href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">Tom
Preston-Werner</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2010/11/docco.md">Reginald
Braithwaite</a>, and <a
href="http://luigimontanez.com/2010/reading-code-is-good-writing-documentation-is-better/">Luigi
Montanez</a> to create a Clojure clone of the excellent <a
href="http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/">Docco</a> documentation
generator written in <a
href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a>. The
byproduct of this motivation was <a
href="https://github.com/fogus/marginalia">Marginalia</a>. The goal of
Marginalia was to create a full-blown <a
href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">literate programming</a>
system<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> with Docco-esque functionality as a
way-station along the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one will give a crap about your crap if your documentation is
crap</p>
<p>– fogus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a very strong opinion regarding the importance of clear and
complete documentation. My reaction to poorly documented code, products,
and services is visceral to the point that I often refuse to release
even the most humble library without code comments, examples, tests,
invariant definitions, a logo, and an “official website”.
<strong>However</strong>, time is not always on my side for personal
projects, so I am constantly looking for ways to minimize the amount of
work required to generate well-documented software without sacrificing
quality. Marginalia is a step in that direction. However, I piddled
around with a comment parser and created the code that builds a tree of
code-lines associated with comment lines. Having scratched that
particular itch I then took a detour into researching literate
programming proper, leaving behind a half-baked mess.</p>
<h2 id="enter-zachary-kim">Enter Zachary Kim</h2>
<p>You may already know <a href="http://zacharykim.com/">Zachary Kim</a>
as the creator of the excellent <a
href="http://clojuredocs.org/">ClojureDocs</a> website; an invaluable
resource for finding Clojure API examples. Zachary resurrected my
original source for Marginalia and single-handedly molded it into a tool
worth using. Marginalia would be nothing without his vision and
hard-work. I would also like to thank <a
href="http://ninjudd.com/">Justin Balthrop</a> and <a
href="http://formpluslogic.blogspot.com/">Brenton Ashworth</a> for their
support and code contributions.</p>
<p><em>If you find Marginalia useful (or even just cool), then please do
visit <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/">ClojureDocs</a> and donate some
of your time to enhance its existing examples and/or fill in the holes
as you find them.</em></p>
<h2 id="current-features">Current features</h2>
<p>Before I dive into a diatribe, I’ll take a moment to go over some of
the details of Marginalia. You can always see the current state of the
<a href="http://fogus.me/fun/marginalia/">output of Marginalia</a>. A
high-level features list currently stands at:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML generation from Clojure source</li>
<li>Markdown support within comments and docstrings</li>
<li>Latex formatting support (via <a
href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>)</li>
<li>Leiningen and Cake support</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Currently Marginalia can be used in a number of ways as described
below. In either case, the output document will be generated in
<code>$PWD/doc/uberdoc.html</code>.</p>
<h3 id="command-line">Command line</h3>
<p>You can download the <a
href="https://github.com/downloads/fogus/marginalia/marginalia-0.3.2-standalone.jar">Marginalia
0.3.2 jar including packaged dependencies from Github</a>.</p>
<p>Running Marginalia given the jar file linked above is as easy as:</p>
<pre><code>java -jar marginalia-0.3.2-standalone.jar</code></pre>
<p>This will search the <code>$PWD</code> for a <code>src</code>
directory which it will then traverse looking for Clojure source files
to parse and generate documentation for. Marginalia also takes specific
locations and files to generate docs for:</p>
<pre><code>java -jar marginalia-0.3.2-standalone.jar &lt;files...&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Arguments can be specific files or directories.</p>
<h3 id="leiningen">Leiningen</h3>
<p>To use Marginalia in your own projects simply add the following to
your <code>project.clj</code> file in the <code>:dev-dependencies</code>
section:</p>
<pre><code>[marginalia &quot;0.3.2&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>After executing <code>lein deps</code> you can generate your complete
source documentation with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>lein marg</code></pre>
<p>More information regarding usage scenarios (e.g. Cake support,
programmatic use, etc.) will be provided on the <a
href="http://fogus.me/fun/marginalia">official Marginalia
website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="todo-features">TODO features</h2>
<p>Marginalia is useable today, but more work is needed. At the moment
the parser is based entirely on regular expressions and as a result
might miss some documentation in code with non-standard formatting.
Fixing the parser is the most glaring need, but other notable plans
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paragraph anchors</li>
<li>Smart code-parser</li>
<li>Modularized documents</li>
<li>Maven support</li>
<li>Alternative output formats</li>
<li>Special handling of <code>:pre</code> and <code>:post</code></li>
<li>Plugins</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know something about Marginalia, why should you want to
use it?</p>
<h2 id="a-new-way-to-think-about-programs">A new way to think about
programs</h2>
<p>What if your code and its documentation were one and the same?</p>
<p>Much of the philosophy guiding literate programming is the
realization of the answer to this question. However, if literate
programming stands as a comprehensive programming methodology at one of
end of the spectrum and no documentation stands as its antithesis, then
Marginalia falls somewhere between. That is, you should always aim for
comprehensive documentation, but the shortest path to a useful subset is
the commented source code itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-marginalia">The art of Marginalia</h2>
<p>If you’re fervently writing code that is heavily documented, then
using Marginalia for your Clojure projects is as simple as running it on
your codebase. However, if you’re unaccustomed to documenting your
source, then the following guidelines<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> will help you make the
most out of Marginalia for true-power documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by running Marginalia against your code</li>
<li>Cringe at the sad state of your code commentary</li>
<li>Add docstrings and code comments<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> as appropriate (I find
smallish functions with descriptive names and comprehensive docstrings
to be ideal – very often docstrings will be longer than the code they
describe)</li>
<li>Generate the documentation again</li>
<li>Read the resulting documentation</li>
<li>Make changes to code and documentation so that the “dialog” flows
sensibly</li>
<li>Repeat the previous 3 steps until complete</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the steps outlined will work to make your code not only
easier to follow – it will make it better. The very process of using
Marginalia will help<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> to crystalize your understanding of
problem and its solution(s). The quality of the prose in your
documentation will often reflect the quality of the code itself thus
highlighting problem areas. The elimination of problem areas will
solidify your code and its accompanying prose. Marginalia provides a
virtuous circle spiraling inward toward maximal code quality.</p>
