## What was the first interesting program that you wrote?

> An early program I wrote that got me excited about the possibilities of computing was a simple evolution program. Bugs moved around on the screen looking for food, with random movement to start. I would start it before bed, with the bugs shaking around, and awake to find they had evolved these fluid, efficient movement strategies. It was then that I realized that simulations and generative programs would allow us to see and discover things that analysis and calculation couldnâ€™t.
