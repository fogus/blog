<p><em><a

a very nice blog post along these same lines</a></em></p>
<p>Last year, <a
href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/10/22/programmer-problem-solving-sequence/">John
D. Cook posted a short, yet poignant post</a> that rings true with some
ideas that I’ve had lately. That is, although I have used “answers
sites” like StackOverflow and Quora from time to time, my feelings about
these sites have over time become fatalistic. While I can certainly
appreciate a site that allows me to start on the path of understanding
<a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3887521/apl-versus-a-versus-j-versus-k/3924091#3924091">the
answers to esoteric questions</a>, I fear for the state of our industry
when confronted with the aforementioned “problem solving sequence”.
People will likely howl that they are too busy to figure things out on
their own and answer sites help them to deliver quality to their
customers, but I don’t buy it. Ask yourself this question – what
benefits your client/employer more: reflexive superficial code copying
or true understanding?</p>
<p>I’m not one to advocate starting each task from ground-zero, but the
growing propensity for turning to answer sites in lieu of <em>any</em>
preparatory research is troubling. Granted, this activity has always
been the bane of Internet forums and mailing lists, but whereas
previously reputation was built on vitriolic responses to such
inanities, today’s Internet rewards the patient doling of common
knowledge with “reputation” and <a
href="http://www.businessinsider.com/prove-your-worth-to-tech-employers-with-new-job-hunting-site-2011-2">specious
promise for future rewards</a>.</p>
<p>Many people however are driven to help others, and I admire their
conviction. However, there are many others whom turn to and engaging in
the business of answers out of reflex or baseless hope for reputation
and reward. These people are selling their natural ability to reason and
solve for expediency and mere baubles.</p>
<p>We can do better than this.</p>
<p>We owe it to our industry, our employers, and ourselves to do better
than this.</p>
<p>To do otherwise reduces us to live as puppets on a string.<a
