*this is a follow-on to a previous post [Never Feel Safe](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/04/21/never-feel-safe/). maybe this is a series? who knows.*

Here are some technologies that I've spent significant time and energy learning, that have seen better days:

- MFC
- Javaspaces
- CORBA
- CLIPS
- HLA
- 6809 assembly language
- 1802 assembly language
- XML-RPC
- Commodore 64 BASIC
- Ant
- TextPad
- XLispStat

My brain at times feels full to the point of tearing at the seams.  There seems to be no room for more.  Would I not be better served by finding a nice safe job maintaining a legacy system using one or more of these technologies that I've agonized over?  

Never.

Seek out the new technologies[^seek].  If your brain feels as if it will burst -- so be it.  Let it burst.  It will heal and you will be a better programmer afterwards.

Never become complacent.

Become obsolete.

:F

[^seek]: "New technologies" is a loaded term.  Bear in mind that "new" and "hot" are orthogonal concerns in my usage.
