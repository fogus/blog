Today marks a turning point.  In addition to being my first day as a member of [Clojure/core](http://clojure.com) and a [programmer of record for Relevance Inc.](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/03/02/relevance-turns-30.html), it also represents my last day as a paid [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) programmer.  

I discovered Scala in mid-2007 and have used it professionally since early 2008.  Needless to say; I have enjoyed my time working with Scala.  In many ways it is a beautiful language and I credit this beauty almost entirely in preserving my sanity after years of full-time Java work.  I have found the community to be intellectually rich, and hold in high regard many of its strongest advocates and luminaries.[^adv]  I wish that I could have been more involved, but at least I was able to release [Baysick](http://github.com/fogus/baysick), and for that I would like to offer my deepest apologies.

I plan to follow the language to the best of my ability, but as one might imagine, my time will be spent on Clojure development and advocacy.  As a consolation[^baysick] (to myself mostly) I would like to offer my notes on Scala collected over 3+ years, styled as a "[Pseudo-annotated Scala Levels](http://www.fogus.me/thunks/scala.html)".

Thanks to everyone involved in Scala, and especially to Dr. Martin Odersky for his leadership and for once [indulging an admirer](http://blog.fogus.me/2010/08/06/martinodersky-take5-tolist/).  It has been a blast.[^blast]

[^blast]: I have both positive and negative opinions on Scala, but this is not the time to go over them.  However, I will say that my opinions are indeed mostly positive.

[^baysick]: Up until the moment of accepting the position with [Relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com) I was fully devoted to submitting an abstract (thanks to a successful first draft) to [Scala Days 2011](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8866) for a silly talk on [Baysick](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1403), but alas...
