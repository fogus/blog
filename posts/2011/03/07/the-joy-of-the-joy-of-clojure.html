<p><a href="http://joyofclojure.com">The Joy of Clojure</a> has gone to
print.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The tentative timeline is as
follows:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Chapters 1, <em>Clojure Philosophy</em> (the “why” of Clojure) and
9, <em>Combining Data and Code</em> (namespaces, multimethods,
prototypes, reify, etc.), will be available as free content from <a
href="http://www.joyofclojure.com/buy">Manning’s Joy page</a>.</li>
<li>The final EBook version will be released by early March. At the
moment it looks like the book will be available in epub, mobi, and pdf
formats.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/fogus/joyofclojure">source code</a>
will be released.</li>
<li>The paperback will be bound and available sometime in mid-March <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935182641?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fogus-20">to
book retailers</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://joyofclojure.com">official website</a> will get
a facelift and new/additional content.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s has been an absolute pleasure<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> working with <a
href="http://blog.n01se.net">Chouser</a><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and
our army of <a href="http://manning.com">Manning</a><a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
editors and proofreaders. I would also like to thank <a
href="http://clj-me.cgrand.net/">Christophe Grand</a> for his
excellent<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> technical review. Additionally, I
would like to thank <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve
Yegge</a> for writing the foreword and providing insightful feedback<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> that I believe made our book all the
stronger. Finally,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> words cannot properly express my
deep respect and gratitude to Rich Hickey the creator of <a
href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> – <a
href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/04/software-needs-philosophers.html">philosopher-programmer</a>.
Without his vision it’s obvious that this book would not have existed,
but furthermore my life would be much the poorer.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The book has taken so much of my time this past year that I can
scarcely fathom what to do next<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. Whatever it will be,<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I hope I can learn<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
even a fraction as much as I did writing <em>Joy</em>.</p>
<p>Hope you like the book.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The book currently stands at about 333 pages. There is
much that we cut that probably could have benefitted the Clojure
community, but for the sake of stronger coherence we decided against
inclusion. I personally wrote (roughly) an additional 100 pages of
material that didn’t make it. I am not sure what the cut count for
Chouser might be, but I suspect it’s significant. Some of this extra
material will make it onto <a href="http://joyofclojure.com">the
official Joy of Clojure website</a>, blog posts, and perhaps another
portion will make it into future editions… when and if they ever
materialize.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Well of course not always – but that is to be expected
when humans deal with humans. I can sometimes be be surly, so I hope
there are no hard feelings.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>OMG… Chouser is smart. If you ever have the chance to
work closely with someone brilliant then jump[^15] at the opportunity.
It is indeed a humbling experience at times, but you will come out of
that experience a smarter and better person overall. There was a time
early in the process when I was on the verge of dropping out of the book
project, but it was the opportunity to work with Chouser that changed my
mind. I’m glad that I did as I found in Chouser a consummate partner and
a true friend.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Speaking from no other point of reference, I must say
that while I didn’t always agree with the decisions made[^13] by Manning
(a claim that they can make against me also), my overall experience with
them was positive. What is the future of publishing? I have no idea.
However, I do see that publishing firms have a clear advantage over
self-publishing through the stunning strength of their editorial staff.
It would be very difficult to self-publish and match the same level of
quality obtainable with the help of professional editors and
proofreaders.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>OMG… Christophe is ridiculously smart.<a href="#fnref5"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>What can I say about Mr. Yegge that everyone doesn’t
already know? I will say that his emails are just as insightful and
witty as his blog posts. I was not expecting that, but I <em>was</em>
pleasantly surprised. It was almost like receiving my own personalized
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants">Drunken
Rants</a>.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Obviously there are many more people deserving thanks,
and we’ve tried to thank them in the book’s acknowledgements.<a
href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Writing a book is a double-edged sword. On the one hand
it is a monumental task that one can be proud of when complete. However,
on the other hand it is an unbelievable pervasive disturbance in one’s
life. To anyone wishing to write a book I have only one piece of advice.
Unless you are 100% certain that you want to write a book and are
willing to sacrifice time for yourself and with your loved ones, and are
able to learn a healthy dose of humility… don’t. I plan to follow[^10]
this advice moving forward.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Having said that, I really think that I’ve spent my book
writing capital. For better or for worse, <em>Joy</em> is the best
possible book that I am able to produce, and I can’t imagine finding
either the ability or the motivation to do it again. Maybe I’m wrong,
and a flash of inspiration will hit me one day, but if that is true,
then it’s too abstract for me to see even as the remotest possibility. I
would much rather return to school and finish my philosophy degree, or
learn Haskell[^12] or OCaml, or <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/02/25/tramp-oline/">Ruby</a>, or Factor,
or NBL,[^14] or Io, or Mozart, or <a
href="http://old.nabble.com/J-Source-GPL-td31045068s24193.html">J</a>,
or Joy, or complete my black belt, or get a Ph.D, or <a
href="http://fogus.me/notes/osdev.html">write an operating system</a>,
or learn to play the Piano, or release these 14 half-baked Clojure
projects, or learn Yoga, or watch the entire run of STNG, or contribute
to <a href="http://blog.n01se.net/?p=41">CinC</a>, or build a lego city
with my kids, or watch more baseball, or take a long trip with my wife,
or read the ANSI Common Lisp standard, or write a program for my kids,
or <a href="http://eventedzen.com">explore the inherent efficiencies</a>
of <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/10/19/the-nothingness-metric/">nothingness</a>,
or build a website with Rails, or learn to play Go and Shogi, or listen
to the complete works of Cluster, or all of the above and more.<a
href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>So I got a <a
href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/03/02/relevance-turns-30.html">job
with Relevance</a> working with some extremely bright people… including,
but not limited to, the <a href="http://clojure.com">Clojure/core
team</a>. I think the words that best describe my feelings are: OMG.
<em>todo: expand my vernacular</em><a href="#fnref10"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Of everyone who will ever read <em>Joy</em>, I will
have learned the most.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
