Skepticism sets in...

> OOP describes the real-world in the same way that the metaphor "Raganwald is a diamond in the rough" describes your ability to act as a piece of jewelry.

No no...

> if you're writing FP in a legacy environment with lots of nasty complex data structures you have a big headache.

Postscript...

> OO is not dead, but pieces of it are definitely gangrenous.
