<p><em>this is the third entry in an n-part <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/tag/clj-compilation">series explaining the
compilation techniques of Clojure</a>.[^cng]</em></p>
<p>There was an interesting <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_frm/thread/d66af49bef572e8a">discussion
about invokedynamic on the Clojure mailing list</a> focused on the need
for and potential benefits of <a
href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292">invokedynamic</a>. Granted
this topic is often quite technical, so I suppose that it’s
understandable that confusion and disagreement would arise. However, the
general tone of the thread and the <a
href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2928285">ensuing Internet
discussion</a> was that Clojure didn’t need invokedynamic. This is
technically true, but there is a distinct difference between
<em>need</em> and <em>benefit</em>. This post will hopefully clarify the
current state of affairs regarding just how invokedynamic can benefit,
and also hurt, Clojure on the JVM.</p>

need invokedynamic</h1>
<p><a

Liron</a> provided a very nice summary of the reasons that invokedynamic
might be unnecessary for Clojure. I highly suggest you read his
assessment as I will only summarize some high points here and in the
next section, offering corrections where his thesis differs from the
realities of the invokedynamic story for Clojure.</p>
<h3 id="java-interop">Java Interop</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at the first potential use of invokedynamic for
Clojure, interop calls. As you may know, Clojure allows one to call Java
class methods directly as below:</p>
<pre><code>(defn at [s] (.charAt s 1))
(at &quot;abc&quot; 1)
;=&gt; \b</code></pre>
<p>However, the call above is problematic in that the compiler cannot
resolve the class of the <code>charAt</code> method so an expensive
route through reflection must take place at runtime. Unfortunately for
us, though <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/whitepaper.html">some common
paths through reflection are indeed optimized</a> by the <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/hotspotfaq-138619.html">JVM
HotSpot</a>, we wouldn’t want to hang our hat on that fact. Would it be
possible therefore to use invokedynamic instead of the reflective call?
Probably. However, it’s worth noting that through compile-time type
inferencing, most interop calls are emitted in the most efficient ways
possible. In fact, most of the interop calls in Clojure are compiled in
the same way that Java itself is compiled. For those times as above when
the Clojure compiler in unable to infer the correct target type, then
Clojure provides type hinting to help the compiler along:</p>
<pre><code>(defn at [^String s] (.charAt s 1))</code></pre>
<p>Like many Lisps, Clojure is built around the principle that one
should write the code correctly first and then only add adornments later
when speed is needed. That is not to say that there is no place for a
scenario whereby invokedynamic is used instead of reflection in the
non-inferred case, but the presence of type hinting makes that scenario
less than urgent and definitely not compelling enough to consider it a
worthwhile venture on its own. I would imagine that time would be better
spent implementing more comprehensive type inferencing. This is a clear
win that would benefit many codebases quickly, with none of the
downsides listed in the last section of this post.</p>
<h3 id="multimethods">Multimethods</h3>
<p>Clojure has a multimethod function type that provides runtime dynamic
dispatch of a named function to a set of unique implementations based on
the result of a separate dispatch function. A simple example is
below:</p>
<pre><code>(defmulti say-count count)
(defmethod say-count 0 [_] &quot;Zero&quot;)
(defmethod say-count 1 [_] &quot;One&quot;)
(defmethod say-count :default [_] &quot;A Bunch&quot;)

(say-count [1 2 3])
;=&gt; A Bunch</code></pre>
<p>As you might see, the multimethod <code>say-count</code> is defined
to dispatch based on the result of the interceding function
<code>count</code>. When <code>count</code> returns <code>0</code> the
specific method associated with that value is invoked. For every call to
a multimethod<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> its dispatch method is called. This
is a potential bottleneck, but what you give up in speed you gain in
flexibility. But does it need to be this way? Can invokedynamic help
alliviate this tradeoff? The answer as it turns out is similar to
interop’s answer. How invokedynamic can help multimethods escapes me,
although they do have a PIC-like doo-dad (technical term) under the hood
– so the jury is still out here.</p>
<h1 id="how-invokedynamic-can-help-clojure">How invokedynamic can help
Clojure</h1>
<p><em>a nice source of core knowledge on this section is this <a
href="http://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/dynamic_invocation_in_the_vm">treatment
of dynamic invocation on the JVM by John Rose</a></em></p>
<p>Before any discussion about how invokedynamic can help begins, it’s
critical to understand what it provides. In a nutshell, invokedynamic
provides the raw material for building efficient <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PolymorphicInlineCaches">polymorphic inline
caches</a> that are subject to finer grained HotSpot optimizations. At
the moment Clojure and JRuby (and others for sure) build those PICs from
“something else” (technical term). However, as I will discuss regarding
Vars next, invokedynamic’s benefits are not limited to the case where
one might find a PIC.</p>
<p>Much of the following is covered by the eminent <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/tree/browse_frm/thread/d66af49bef572e8a/3a21f40138f22c0d?rnum=21&amp;_done=%2Fgroup%2Fclojure%2Fbrowse_frm%2Fthread%2Fd66af49bef572e8a%3F#doc_63423c53208effdf">Paul
Stadig in the original thread</a>, but I’ll provide an overview
below.</p>
<h3 id="def">def</h3>
<p>At the core of Clojure’s dynamic heart is the Var. At it’s most
boiled (i.e. before taking into account dynamic or thread-local
bindings), a Var is a single point of mutability that holds a value or
function. Clojure as a Lisp is predicated on the ability to change a
function definition at any time. In production this explicit function
redefinition is not used very much, but at the REPL, Clojure’s
interactive console, this capability is used to great effect in
incrementally building a solution and in-place sanity checking
(i.e. REPL-based testing).</p>
<p>To provide this level of flexibility Clojure establishes a level of
indirection.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Specifically, all function lookups
through a Var occur, at the lowest level, through an atomic volatile.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This happens every time that a
function bound using the <code>def</code>/<code>defn</code> special
forms is called. This indirection is not amenable to HotSpot
optimizations.</p>
<p>This is a great place for invokedynamic, especially during production
scenarios where the root value of Vars remain stable. That is,
invokedynamic would eliminate the volatile lookup on every call and
likely lead to HotSpot inlining. From another perspective, the JVM
provides a way to change out class implementations on the fly via
something called safepoints. This implementation swapping is analogous,
if not a mirror of, the swapping of Var root bindings. Safepoints are
intuitively viewed as stable execution points where interrupts can be
utilized to save JVM state, thus allowing magic (technical term) to
happen safely and atomically. At the moment, invokedynamic is the
<em>only</em> path to safepoints for the JVM language implementor. It
would be awesome (technical term) to have a direct path to safepoints,
but I digress.</p>
