<p>I recently compiled a list of <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/08/14/perlis-languages/">Perlis
Languages</a> that were meant to illustrate varying paradigms not
typically found in mainstream programming languages. Those languages
were meant to stretch your mind and are not necessarily representative
of the state of the art in language design and implementation. In this
post I will provide a list of fairly new languages (let’s say 5 years
with a little flex) that display<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> interesting features and
display higher-order thinking in the way that they tend toward an
evolution of past learnings in programming language thinking. Not all of
these languages enjoy active development, but the more important point
is that they represent in some way “new language thinking”. Remember
that this goal does not necessarily mean “innovative”.</p>
<p>Unlike my Perlis post, I have not fully explored all of the languages
below, so caveat emptor. Please correct me if I misrepresent something.
No meaning behind the ordering implied.</p>

<h2 id="shen">Shen</h2>
<p><em>released: 2011, author: Dr. Mark Tarver</em></p>
<p>I included the fantastic language Qi in my Perlis Languages post, so
it may seem gratuitous to include its successor Shen here. In fact Shen
and Qi offer most of (all of?) the same high-level features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Lisp</li>
<li>Optional static typing</li>
<li>Pattern matching with guards</li>
<li>Macros</li>
<li>Partial application</li>
<li>Function backtracking</li>
<li>Builtin Prolog</li>
<li>Builtin compiler compiler</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Shen is indeed the next evolutionary step after Qi. Shen
builds on the ideas in Qi in various ways, but the primary motivating
force is targetability. What exactly does that mean? The precursor Qi
was built to target Common Lisp as its host language and did so to
maximum effect. However, Qi was found to target a very small subset of
Common Lisp. Therefore, Dr. Tarver devised the idea that the successor
Shen should be defined in terms of a minimal kernel Lisp language called
Kl which would, in theory, provide an easier port target across various
runtime hosts, including, but not limited to: JavaScript, Python,
Clojure, and Common Lisp. I have been thinking of “kernel Lisps” a lot
and so Shen is ripe with ideas.</p>
<p>An example of a <code>member</code> function using the embedded
Prolog:</p>
<pre><code>(defprolog member
  X [X | _] &lt;--;
  X [_ | Y] &lt;-- (member X Y);)

(prolog? (member 1 [1 2 3]))
/*=&gt; true */</code></pre>
<p>Partial application is automatic (simplified below):</p>
<pre><code>(* 2)
/*=&gt; #&lt;FUNCTION LAMBDA (x) (* 2 x)&gt;

((* 2) 54)
/*=&gt; 108 */</code></pre>
<p>Here is a function that calculates the nth triangle number:</p>
<pre><code>(define triangle
  0 -&gt; 0
  N -&gt; (+ N (triangle (- N 1))))

(triangle 100)
/*=&gt; 5050 */</code></pre>
<p>And a typed version of the same:</p>
<pre><code>(tc +)  /* turn on type-checking */

(define triangle
  {number --&gt; number}
  0 -&gt; 0
  N -&gt; (+ N (triangle (- N 1))))

(triangle 5)
/*=&gt; 15 : number */

(triangle a)    
/* type error */</code></pre>
<p>Shen is a natural evolutionary step along the long, winding path that
is Lisp history. Many modern programming languages are absorbing
features that Lisp innovated long ago, but still the most exciting
languages are Lisps.</p>

<h2 id="agda-2">Agda 2</h2>
<p><em>released: 2009, author: Ulf Norel</em></p>
<p>I’ve yet to truly wrap my head around Agda (any year now), but I can
say a few things about it. First, Agda is a purely functional, pattern
matching, dependently typed programming language that walks the thin
border adjacent to proof assistants. In dependently typed languages,
type expressions can contain (depend on) a program expression.
Therefore, the resolution of type constraints is a function of code or
predicated on values. It’s like a kick in the face. As an added bonus,
the Agda type language is the same as the value language (i.e. the
programming language itself). What this means is that type invariants in
Agda can express a much wider spectrum of constraints than typically
attributed to static type systems; for example, <a
href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/%7Etxa/publ/ydtm.pdf">a list type that
statically guarantees sorted order</a> (PDF). There’s a drop-kick for
you.</p>
<p>Here is an encoding of even and odd numbers in the Agda type
system:</p>
<pre><code>data Nat : Set where
  zero : Nat
  suc  : Nat -&gt; Nat

fortyTwo : Nat
fortyTwo = 42

plus : Nat -&gt; Nat -&gt; Nat
plus  zero   m = m
plus (suc n) m = suc (plus n m)

mutual
  even : Nat -&gt; Bool
  even zero    = true
  even (suc n) = odd n

  odd : Nat -&gt; Bool
  odd zero    = false
  odd (suc n) = even n</code></pre>
<p>The previous code defines two datatypes: 1) the natural numbers and
2) the even natural numbers. You can also define type functions as infix
operators:</p>
<pre><code>_+_ : Nat -&gt; Nat -&gt; Nat
zero  + m = m
suc n + m = suc (n + m)</code></pre>
<p>This represents the extent of my understanding about Agda so far.
While it would be nice to know more, what I’ve seen is amazing enough to
warrant inclusion.</p>

<h2 id="ioke">Ioke</h2>
<p><em>released: 2008, author: Ola Bini</em></p>
<p>Ola Bini’s <a href="http://ioke.org">Ioke</a> is based on a simple
question: what kind of language can you build if you completely
disregard performance and instead focus on expressivity?<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> As
it turns out you gain incredible expressiveness as shown in Bini’s
presentation series (links below). One of the more interesting aspects
of Ioke is that it is a homoiconic language providing macros.</p>
<pre><code>myfor = dsyntax(
&quot;takes a name, an enumerable, and a transforming expr
and returns the result of transforming each entry in 
expression, with the current value of the enumerable
bound to the name given as the first argument&quot;,

  [argName, enumerable, argCode]

  &#39;&#39;(`enumerable map(`argName, `argCode))
)

myfor(x, 1..5, x*2) 
;=&gt; [2,4,6,8,10]</code></pre>
<p>Another advantage in studying Ioke is my own personal first
axiom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When brilliant people create things, study them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As programmers the onus is on us to push our skills to the point of
uncomfortableness. Studying the works of great minds is a highly
effective way to do this.</p>

<h2 id="pure">Pure</h2>
<p><em>released: 2008, author: Albert Gräf</em></p>
<p>Pure is a functional language built around <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/wiki/PurePrimer1#Term_rewriting">term
rewriting</a>. Term rewriting is very similar to what we did in
high-school algebra using the FOIL method:</p>
<pre><code>(x1 + y1) * (x2 + y2) = 
  (x1 * x2) +            // First
  (x1 * y2) +            // Outer 
  (y1 * x2) +            // Inner 
  (y1 * y2);             // Last</code></pre>
<p>The code above defines the steps needles to transform the
multiplication of two binomials into the FOIL steps. Testing this
rewrite rule yields:</p>
<pre><code>(x + 3) * (x + 5);
//=&gt; x*x+x*5+3*x+15</code></pre>
