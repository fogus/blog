<p>John McCarthy was a genius of the highest order. Much is known about
his contribution to Lisp as its inventor, but he was also the mind
behind much of early AI research, the progenitor of much of computer
chess, and the initiator of time-sharing. As a Lisp advocate I have many
thanks due to John McCarthy and it saddens me that I will never have the
chance to give them. However, like many geniuses McCarthy was surrounded
by likewise brilliant creators and thinkers. This post is devoted to
some of the brilliant minds that influenced, provoked, and in one case
defied McCarthy for the betterment of the early LISP history spawning
the Lisp world that we now enjoy. So goes the history of monumental
minds that their likewise monumental shadow engulfs those whose help was
critical to the larger historical significance.</p>
<h2 id="steve-russell">Steve Russell</h2>
<p>That Steve Russell created the first LISP evaluator is fairly well
known, so to include his name on this list is questionable. However,
it’s important to note that has it not been for his effort the history
of LISP as a language might have never occurred and if it had then it
would have manifested very differently. In early 1959, Steve Russell
took the theoretical idea that was LISP devised by his employer John
McCarthy and hand-compiled the “Universal LISP Function” to operate on
the IBM 704. In a survey of one, I suppose the lesson is to never listen
to your boss.</p>
<p>The implementation was novel in that it utilized the machine
capabilities to maximum effect. However, unbeknownst to Russell, and
early decision would “haunt” LISP even up to today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of an unfortunate temporary lapse of inspiration, we couldn’t
think of any other names for the 2 pointers in a list node than
“address” and “decrement,” so we called the functions CAR for “Contents
of Address of Register” and CDR for “Contents of Decrement of
Register.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a contributor to <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> it
always brings a smile to my face when people deride its lack of
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. What seems a priceless nostalgic
gem to some is but the leavings from a lack of inspiration some 50+
years ago.</p>
<h2 id="dan-edwards">Dan Edwards</h2>
<p>Dan Edwards (gc) during June/July of 1959 wrote the garbage collector
that would serve up to the 1.5 release of LISP. (McCarthy 1962)
According to McCarthy, the garbage collector worked as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At any given time only a part of the memory reserved for list
structures will actually be in use for storing S-expressions. The
remaining registers (in our system the number, initially, is
approximately 15,000) are arranged in a single list called the
free-storage list. A certain register, FREE, in the program contains the
location of the first register in this list. When a word is required to
form some additional list structure, the first word on the free-storage
list is taken and the number in register FREE is changed to become the
location of the second word on the free-storage list. No provision need
be made for the user to program the return of registers to the
free-storage list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edwards, Michael Levin, and Hart (below) also proved the equivalency
between the alpha-beta and minimax search algorithms, (Edwards 1961)
that was also overshadowed by McCarthy given that he seemingly <a
href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/slides/wrong/wrong-sli/wrong-sli.html">invented
alpha-beta out of thin air in 1955</a>.</p>
<h2 id="timothy-hart">Timothy Hart</h2>
<p>Macros are a ubiquitous element for any Lisp language in use today,
but the fact is that they were not part of the early LISP
implementations. Instead, LISP macros were invented years after
Russell’s first implementation by Hart and were described in a scrawled
3-page document called <em>MACRO Definitions for LISP</em> published as
an MIT memo. (Hart 1963) This short but epic document described an
extension to the <a
href="http://fogus.me/static/preso/magnificent7/#slide10">original
seven-function LISP <code>eval</code></a> that looked effectively like
the following:</p>
<pre><code>((eq (caar expr) (quote macro))
 (cond
   ((eq (cadar expr) (quote lambda))
    (eval (eval (car (cdddar expr))
                (cons (list (car (caddar expr)) 
                            (cadr expr)) 
                      binds))
          binds))))</code></pre>
<p>I’ve extended <a
href="https://github.com/fogus/lithp/blob/master/src/core.lisp#L107">my
Lithp interpreter with Hart-style macros</a> if you’d like to play with
such a beast.</p>
<h2 id="nathaniel-rochester-and-herbert-gelernter">Nathaniel Rochester
and Herbert Gelernter</h2>
<p>It’s hard to imagine how Rochester, the creator of the first
assembler, could be overshadowed by McCarthy, but from a LISP
perspective he certainly is. The influence of Rochester and Gelernter
are likely deeper than I know, but in one instance theirs is a negative
influence. That is, McCarthy at one point was considering an extended
version of Fortran with list processing capabilities for his AI
research, of which such a system was developed by Rochester and
Gelernter. However, McCarthy realized that such a library did not
adequately serve his needs which led him to explore the creation of a
language more suited to his AI explorations and LISP was the result.</p>
<h2 id="alan-r.-kotok">Alan R. Kotok</h2>
<p>Alan Kotok, one of the designers of the PDP-10 was driven to design a
machine that could effectively host a LISP system. The PDP-10 is, at its
core, is built with an eye toward LISP. Indeed, the 36-bit word size is
there because LISP implementations benefited from two 18-bit pointers
per word (the elements of a cons cell). It’s unclear how the PDP-10
influenced LISP, if at all,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but I thought that this
was a great story and a preview of the Lisp Machines that would come
years later.</p>
<h2 id="others-and-inaccuracies">Others and Inaccuracies?</h2>
<p>Did I misrepresent something here? Please let me know.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are many others involved with the early days of
LISP whose contributions were not easy to find, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul W. Abrahams</li>
<li>Robert K. Brayton</li>
<li>Saul Goldberg</li>
<li>David Luckham</li>
<li>Michael Levin</li>
<li>More…</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any information about these pioneers, or are the pioneers
themselves, then please comment here with pointers to more information
and I will add it to the main post body.</p>
