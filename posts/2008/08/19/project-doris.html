<h1 id="project-doris">Project Doris</h1>
<p>Project Doris is actually the name of a programming language –
actually it’s three programming languages. I suppose some explanation is
in order.</p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-project-doris">A History of Project Doris</h2>
<p>It’s probably wise to begin at the beginning. Right after obtaining
my <a href="http://www.smcm.edu">undergraduate degree</a>, I obtained
work as a programmer for a <a href="http://www.dcscorp.com">medium-sized
company</a> located in Lexington Park, MD. My task for this company was
to create an expert system that was able to best <a
href="http://www.aaai.org/Library/IAAI/2005/iaai05-002.php">determine
the loading of navy aircraft and their sequence of release</a>, which
apparently is still a living entity, although my initial version is
probably long gone (which looking back is probably a good thing). Being
an expert system, it was natural that the source code be written in the
<a href="http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net">CLIPS programming
language</a>. Having no prior experience with CLIPS, it made very little
sense to me at first, yet I was not to be detered. In order to make an
attempt to wrap my head around the CLIPS language I decided to go into
the C source and muck it up in order to make it look more akin to <a
href="http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/xls/xlsinfo/xlsinfo.html">something
that I was already accustomed to</a>. Overall my efforts were useful for
learning the internals and function of CLIPS, but it was essentially
throw-away code as the requirement was to write the system in
CLIPS-proper (seriously, this was an <em>actual</em> requirement for
some strange reason). Sadly, the originally modified source was left on
my computer when I left that particular company (the first time) and is
likely lost to the dustbin of history. However, the bug for modification
has struck again and Project Doris is the attempt to reuse some of the
same ideas that I originally had coupled with some new ideas that I have
germinated in my mind since.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-the-heck-is-project-doris">So what the heck is Project
Doris?</h2>
<p>Aside from being an homage to <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fogus/2112947183/in/set-72157603478752122">my
lovely grandmother</a> (RIP), I suppose you could call Project Doris a
modernization of CLIPS, but even that would be too presumptuous. In
reality, it is the creation of four programming languages (plus some
other stuff) using the CLIPS source code as the base.</p>
<h2 id="four-languages-wtf">Four Languages?!? WTF?</h2>
<p>I know what you’re thinking, “does the world really need” another
programming language, much less four more?” My answer to you my friends
is and emphatic <strong>YES</strong>. The world not only needs four
more, but it needs <em>forty-thousand</em> more. That is, the
programming landscape would be much richer if programmers took some time
and designed their own little <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language">DSLs</a>
and hacked-up programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="you-arrogant-bastard">You arrogant bastard!</h2>
<p>Again, I know what your next reaction might be: “So you think you can
do better with CLIPS than Gary Riley, Brian Dantes, Brian Donnell, Frank
Lopez, and NASA?”</p>
<p>My answer is a high-pitched <sub>no</sub>. but you see, my goal is
not to make a better version of CLIPS, it only to see how far the
original source can be stretched and mangled. I do not wish to usurp
CLIPS; in fact, I would be quite shocked (and awed) if anyone but myself
ever used anything that comes out of Project Doris. I am a true believer
in the CLIPS language, but I am more of a believer in the idea of taking
someone else’s idea and taking stuff away until it is awesome. CLIPS is
20 some-odd years old and has an established user base who are happy
with it the way it is (not that 20 some-odd years of history much allows
for much change in the language itself). Besides, using the CLIPS source
as the base allows me to leverage existing code – who has time to write
a garbage collector, parser, and Rete implementation? Not me.</p>
<h1 id="common-ground">Common Ground</h1>
<p>There will be some common functionality between the three
sub-languages that comprise Doris, some of which have not yet been
decided. However, the current list of common parts is as follows.</p>
<h2 id="has">Has</h2>
<h3 id="blocks">Blocks</h3>
<p>In the olden days, my initial implementation of a block structure was
simply syntactic sugar for the <code>(progn)</code> function. This may
or may not be the way to go moving forward, but in any case I like the
idea of passing code blocks around. This is not the same as a Ruby block
but instead a nameable set of actions that can be applied at certain
points and which can access the current lexical scope. In addition,
parametrized blocks would provide a general closure mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>The base CLIPS module system will primarily be used as a packaging
mechanism for packaging libraries. The fact-base partitioning capability
that the <code>(defmodule)</code> constructs has always provided a
powerful mechanism and will largely remain unchanged. I plan to extend
the base capability by providing aliasing.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>The fundamental data structure shared between languages will be none
other than the truty list. CLIPS itself has a scaled-back version of the
list called a multifield which simply put can be thought of as a
single-level list (i.e. no embedded lists). Multifields are fine and
good, but I need to be able to store any structure in a list, including
lists. Therefore, with a little bit of effort I was able to get true
lists working. Lists in Doris are not like classic Lisp lists in that
they are built up as pairs, but are instead backed by arrays.</p>
<h2 id="privative">Privative</h2>
<h3 id="globals">Globals</h3>
<p>It is ashamed that after years of being bitten by global variables
that languages are still being created that provide them.</p>
<h1 id="broccoli">Broccoli</h1>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>I have been working on a language called <a
href="http://www.earthvssoup.com/projects/broccoli">Broccoli</a>
(previously Vodka) for quite some time now, but the <a
href="http://www.earthvssoup.com/2007/11/23/lithp-v001/">original
interpreter was written in Python</a>. Sometime about 4 months ago I
decided to use the CLIPS source as the basis for Broccoli and it turned
out to work quite well. There are some major differences in that there
is no real support for anonymous functions, but I believe that I have a
way to hack that into the CLIPS interpreter. Over the past 4 months I
have made quite a few changes to the CLIPS source and what remains is
vaguely recognizable as being rooted in CLIPS.</p>
<h3 id="anonymous-functions">Anonymous functions</h3>
<p>One aspect that I have always felt was missing (and is actually
discouraged) from CLIPS was that of anonymous functions. There is
support for indirectly calling functions by using the
<code>(funcall)</code> function with a symbol corresponding to the name
of an existing function, but it would be nice to eliminate this extra
step in many cases. It is often appropriate, desirable, and <a
href="http://www.jquery.com">beautiful</a> to chain functions together,
and this can be elegantly done by simply allowing the creation of
anonymous functions within certain language constructs. The precise
mechanism behind implementing this is only a vague and cloudy mess in
the back of my mind at the moment. It seems that the most difficult
aspect would be the disposal of the anonymous functions as they drop out
of scope, but perhaps an <code>(undeffunction)</code> call can be bound
to the internal anonymous symbolic name, but the implications of this
are yet to be determined.</p>
