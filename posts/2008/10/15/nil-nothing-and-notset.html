<p>One of the more nagging elements of Java programming (and programming
in general) is that there is a coarseness to the representation of the
conditions nil, nothing, and notset. In Java, one typically uses
<code>null</code> to represent all three of these conditions and the
semantics for the <em>actual</em> meaning lies in the secret incantation
of its usage. While playing around with my hobby language <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/jaka/tree/master">Jaka</a> I felt that
there could be a finer way to deal with these conditions using a set of
objects known as object references.</p>
<h2 id="nil">nil</h2>
<p>In Jaka, <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/jaka/tree/master/src/scala/fogus/jaka/Existential.scala">nil</a>
is used to represent an object that has no possible value. Since, Jaka
is built around the <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/jaka/tree/master/src/jaka/fogus/jaka/Cons.scala">Cons</a>
data structure, the really only idiomatic usage of nil is for its
termination. However, there are conceivably other instances where “no
possible value” could come into play. Of all of the object reference
types, nil is the only that an object can be explicitly set.</p>
<h2 id="notset">notset</h2>
<p>While nil represents the case where an object can have no possible
value, <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/jaka/tree/master/src/scala/fogus/jaka/Existential.java">notset</a>
describes an object whose value has never been defined. When an object
is defined without a value it is implicitly marked as notset. Jaka is
designed such that any defined objects are immutable, so it is useful to
distinguish those that have not been set.</p>
<pre lang="lisp">
(def x)
x  => gives notset
(def y x)  => error condition, x was never set 
</pre>
But the real win is when you access a map with a key that was never set:
<pre lang="lisp">
(def m {a 1 b 2})
(get m a)  => 1
(get m c)  => notset
</pre>
<h2 id="nothing">nothing</h2>
<p>Jaka distinguishes between an object having no possible value, an
unknown value, and with <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/jaka/tree/master/src/scala/fogus/jaka/Existential.java">nothing</a>,
the non-existence of an object. One of the driving goals of Jaka is to
eliminate needless earth-shattering exceptions. Most languages will
choke if an undefined variable is even referenced, but Jaka will happily
assign it as nothing and move on. What this means to something like
addition is TBD, but for something as fundamental as equality it’s a
no-brainer.</p>
<pre lang="lisp">
(def x 2)
(is x z)  => z was never defined, so it's "value" is nothing and the equality check is false
</pre>
<p>Of course, if you try to check the equality of two nothing objects a
hole in the space-time continuum is ripped opened.</p>
