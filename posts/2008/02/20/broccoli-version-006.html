<p>I have been working on programming language interpreters for
seemingly forever, but only recently has the effort born any fruit. That
is, 95% of all of my langdev projects have been throw-aways or
work-related DSLs; however, Broccoli one is more suitable for public
consumption.</p>
<h2>
What Broccoli Is Not
</h2>
<p><strong>Broccoli is not Lisp/Scheme/Arc/etc…</strong> That is,
Broccoli is not a functional language. It certainly has some functional
elements, but it is far from treating functions as first-class objects.
In addition, Broccoli lists are in fact fundamental data types whereas
they are not in <a href="http://clisp.cons.org">Lisp</a> and
<a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/mzscheme">Scheme</a> (not
sure about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>).
Finally, Broccoli also contains those pesky parenthesis, but that and a
few similar function names are as close to Lisp/Scheme/Arc/etc… as
Broccoli gets. There are most likely millions of other ways that
Broccoli differs, but these are the root differences.</p>
<p><strong>Broccoli is not Fast</strong> That is, Broccoli is a fully
interpreted language that does not contain much in the way of
optimizations ala
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT
compilation</a>. That is to say that it cannot one day be fast, only
that it is not the goal to start.</p>
<p><strong>Broccoli is not (fully) Object-Oriented</strong> In fact, at
the moment Broccoli is not “Object-Oriented” in the least. I will one
day build an object system into it (it would actually be quite easy);
however even when that day comes, Broccoli will provide support for
functions and primitive types.</p>
<p><strong>Broccoli is not (yet) Open Source</strong> But it
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">will be</a>
one day.</p>
<h2>
What Broccoli Is
</h2>
<p><strong>Broccoli is the language specification of Broccoli</strong>
What on earth does that mean? In essence it means that the form of
Broccoli is the parse form of the Broccoli language (see
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">ROtNs</a> for more details
on this recursive definition).</p>
<p><strong>Broccoli is succinct and familiar</strong> I have tried (and
will continue) to use names that are familiar to an important part of
the programming community…
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fogus/">me</a>. I will not
sacrifice succinctness to reach this aim however.</p>
<p>To learn more about Broccoli, check out the
<a href="/projects/broccoli/">manual</a>, request a binary, play around,
or just slag me online (oh wait).</p>
