<blockquote>But if you don't want to transmit the extra delimiters, you can save bandwidth by making your code uniquely-decodable even without delimiters. The delimiters are a special case of a more general principle, which is that a prefix code is always uniquely-decodable. A prefix code is one where no code word is a prefix of another.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We want to restore the World Wide Web to its rightful place as a respected architecture for distributed programming. We want to shift the focus of web service programming from an RPC-style architecture that just happens to use HTTP as a transfer protocol, to a URI-based architecture that uses the technologies of the web to their fullest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Linear Lisp requires the programmer to make explicit any duplication and deletion, but he is repaid through better error checking during compilation and better utilization of resources (time, space) at run-time. Furthermore, distributed and/or parallel execution becomes quite palatable in Linear Lisp.</blockquote>
