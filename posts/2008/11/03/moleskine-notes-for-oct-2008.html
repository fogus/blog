<blockquote>
<p>Originally you choose one of three doors which have equally
randomized probabilities. You have on average a 1/3 chance of being
right. Consequently, the chance that you are wrong is 2/3. If you stick
with that original choice, then nothing that happens afterward changes
those probabilities. In other words, the chance of the winning door
being ONE OF THE OTHER TWO is 2/3 - regardless of what happens next.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When Monty Hall shows you a losing door from these other two, he is
helping you enormously. He is effectively saying, “Look, the chance of
the prize being behind one of these two doors (of the three) is 2/3, and
I’m going to help you by showing you one of them which ISN’T the
winner.” After he has done this, the probability of your original door
being the right one doesn’t suddenly jump to 50%, when it was only 33.3%
beforehand. Why on earth should it? Your original choice was one out of
three. If you played the game 100 times and stuck with the original
choice you’d end up being right about 33 times, REGARDLESS of whether
Monty Hall showed you what was behind any one, two or all of the doors.
To repeat, you chose one of three doors originally, and if you stick
with that choice you have a one in three chance of being right. End of
story.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>With 3 doors, each door starts with a 1/3 chance.
p(DoorA) = 33%, p(DoorB) = 33%, p(DoorC) = 33%.

Or put another way... 
If you pick A: 
    p(DoorA) = 33%, p(DoorB or DoorC) = 67%.
Remove DoorB and the goat behind it and you&#39;re left with: 
    p(DoorA) = 33%, p(DoorC) = 67%.</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>In the present problem Monty Hall is giving you additional
information about the distribution of probabilities by showing you a
“losing” door.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s why the million door analogy is so helpful in clarifying. You
started with a freakin huge probability that you picked the wrong door
And only a 1/1,000,000 chance that you picked the right door. If Monty
then removes doors with goats behind them until their are only two doors
left, the one you originally picked and one other (the other being the
one door he’s been avoiding picking). The odds that you originally
picked the right door are still 1 in a million, the odds that the one
other door is the correct door are 999,999/1,000,000. So given those
odds you should probably switch doors when given the opportunity. I
certainly would.</p>
