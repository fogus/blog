<p>Once again it is time for my yearly rundown of the applications that
I have found most useful over the past year (see entries for <a
href="/2007/05/01/favorite-apps-of-the-computers-2007/">2007</a>, <a
href="/2005/03/04/these-are-a-few-of-my-favorite-things/">2005</a>, and
<a href="/2004/04/17/203/">2004</a>).</p>
<p>Without further delay.</p>
<h3 id="web-framework">Web Framework</h3>
<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sandoz/date/20081201">Jersey</a>: There
came a time at my job when the word REST <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> was
being bandied about with impunity. Since I was slowly discovering the
virtues of a RESTful approach, it fell upon me to put together a
demonstration for my project team and my framework of choice was Jersey.
There are a number of things that I have found wonderful about
Jersey:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dead simple model for representing <a
href="http://blogs.sun.com/sandoz/entry/services_are_clients_too">REST
resources and clients</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://blogs.sun.com/sandoz/entry/annotated_scala_groovy_jruby_rhino">Annotations
based</a></li>
<li>Nice integration with <a
href="http://www.springsource.org">Spring</a></li>
<li>Works extremely well with <a
href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="text-editor">Text Editor</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>: I
have been using Emacs for a few years and for a time I truly thought
that I was quite productive with it. However, after being exposed to
some truly prolific Emacs users in the past year (just about everyone I
work with), I soon learned <a
href="/2008/07/23/confessions-of-a-textual-loser/">just how clueless I
really was concerning Emacs</a>. Therefore, I have taken it on to live
in Emacs and the results are promising. I will not make sweet love to
myself just yet… there is more work to be done.</p>
<h4 id="runner-ups">Runner up(s)</h4>
<p>The whole point this year has been to scrap all other text editors
and work with Emacs.</p>
<h3 id="ide">IDE</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>: I was going to put <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a> here, but
I assumed that all of my half-dozen readers would click away in disgust
over “yet another one of <em>those</em> posts”. And really, the pick of
Eclipse isn’t that far off considering that most of my daily paycheck
programming is done with Java and <a
href="/2008/10/20/groovin-with-scala/">Scala</a>, and that my group has
extended the framework extensively, Eclipse is (for now) the defacto
choice for me (although, the Scala support is only less sucky than the
other alternatives that I’ve tried).</p>
<h4 id="runner-ups-1">Runner up(s)</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>: And
since my for-fun programming is done in <a
href="http://www.clojure.org">Clojure</a>, it is absolutely essential to
do so using <a
href="http://github.com/jochu/swank-clojure/tree/master">Swank-Clojure</a>.
In addition, I tend to <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/ix/tree/master">do a lot of C</a> in my
spare time, so I’ve found the Emacs support quite pleasant.</p>
<h3 id="operating-system">Operating System</h3>
<p><em>OSX</em>: I have been using OSX since the beginning and cannot
imagine going back to another OS.</p>
<h3 id="programming-language">Programming Language</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.clojure.org">Clojure</a>: I have found Clojure to
be a joy to use. I have <a
href="http://twitter.com/fogus/status/1075566397">espoused its
virtues</a> from time to time, and have devoted a significant <a
href="/tag/onlisp">portion</a> of my (dwindling) free time <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/elgar/tree/master">working with it</a>. I
have always spent my spare cycles coding up my own projects, but never
have I found such joy in it. Hell, I even talk to <a
href="http://www.modus-tollens.com">my wife</a> about it at the dinner
table. I cannot imagine that this is what she dreamed of when she said,
“I do.”</p>
<h4 id="runner-ups-2">Runner up(s)</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>: A late comer to my 2008
favorites party. That’s not to say that I have just discovered Python;
on the contrary I have used on and off it for a couple years. However,
the release of <a
href="http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html">Python 3000</a>
has gotten me excited to get back into it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a>: I was once very happy
with Java. In fact, it was only a year ago that I found a new-found love
for it after reading the <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321356683/?tag=fogus-20">Bloch
tome</a>. However, a year of reflection, coupled with the <a
href="/2008/10/20/groovin-with-scala/">discovery of Scala</a> has shone
a new light on the matter. I also like that while the <a
href="http://www.is-research.de/info/vmlanguages/">JVM languages</a>
tend toward dynamic typing, Scala preaches that Java just wasn’t static
enough. If I had to pick the eventual “winner”<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> of
the JVM languages, it would be Scala.</p>
