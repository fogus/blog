<h1 id="thinking-about-scala">Thinking about Scala</h1>
<p>Scala at the core allows mutable and immutable objects based with the
following observation: &gt;Objects can be mutable or immutable. The
latter is preferred when it’s possible, since it needs no concurrency
control. Also, these days it’s faster to make new objects and allow them
to be efficiently GC’ed, than incur the GC overhead</p>
<p>Incurring GC overhead <em>It is important that I understand what this
means.</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Traits</p>
<p>are like interfaces <strong>except</strong> they can provide default
method impls. mixin capability</p></li>
<li><p>Singletons</p>
<p>are used instead of statics</p></li>
<li><p>Actors</p>
<p>used to provide async messaging</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Scala has two <em>interesting</em> things: 1. Implicits Once again we
are bashed over the head with globals and side-effects.</p>

<li>Pattern matching (algebraic types)</li>

reading [Steve Yegge’s thoughts on dynamic languages][yegge1]</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>C++you’ve got your virtual method dispatch, which is what C++ you
know, sort of evangelists, that’s the first thing they go after, like in
an interview, “tell me how a virtual method table works!” Right? Out of
all the features in C++, they care a lot about that one, because it’s
the one they have to pay for at run time, and it drives them nuts! It
drives them nuts because the compiler doesn’t know, at run time, the
receiver’s type.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you call foo.bar(), foo could be some class that C++ knows about,
or it could be some class that got loaded in afterwards. And so it winds
up this polymorphism winds up meaning the compiler can compile both the
caller and the callee, but it can’t compile them together. So you get
all the overhead of a function call. Plus, you know, the method lookup.
Which is more than just the instructions involved. You’re also blowing
your instruction cache, and you’re messing with all these, potentially,
code optimizations that could be happening if it were one basic-block
fall-through.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So what he (Urs) does, is he has these counters at hot spots in the
code, in the VM. And they come in and they check the types of the
arguments (or operands). And they say, all right, it looks like a bunch
of them appear to be class B, where we thought it might be class A.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So what we’re gonna do is generate this fall-through code that says,
all right, if it’s a B Ð so they have to put the guard instruction in
there; it has to be correct: it has to handle the case where they’re
wrong, OK? But they can make the guard instruction very, very fast,
effectively one instruction, depending on how you do it. You can compare
the address of the intended method, or you can maybe do a type-tag
comparison. There are different ways to do it, but it’s fast, and more
importantly, if it’s right, which it is 80-90% of the time, it falls
through (i.e., inlines the method for that type - Ed.), which means you
maintain your processor pipeline and all that stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The syntax of a language, unless it’s Scheme, gives you a lot of
clues about the semantics, right? That’s actually the one place, maybe,
where lots of syntax actually wins out (over Scheme).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So javac, the Java compiler: what does it do? Well, it generates
bytecode, does some optimizations presumably, and maybe tells you some
errors. And then you ship it off to the JVM. And what happens to that
bytecode? First thing that happens is they build a tree out of it,
because the bytecode verifier has to go in and make sure you’re not
doing anything (illegal). And of course you can’t do it from a stream of
bytes: it has to build a usable representation. So it effectively
rebuilds the source code that you went to all that effort to put into
bytecode.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But that’s not the end of it, because maybe javac did some
optimizations, using the old Dragon Book. Maybe it did some constant
propagation, maybe it did some loop unrolling, whatever.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The next thing that happens in the JVM is the JIT undoes all the
optimizations! Why? So it can do better ones because it has runtime
information. … So it undoes all the work that javac did, except maybe
tell you that you had a parse error.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And to us, C++ was the ultimate in Roman decadence. I mean, it was
equivalent to going and vomiting so you could eat more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is, picture an ant walking across your garage floor,
trying to make a straight line of it. It ain’t gonna make a straight
line. And you know this because you have perspective. You can see the
ant walking around, going hee hee hee, look at him locally optimize for
that rock, and now he’s going off this way, right?</p>

id="static-vs.-dynamic-vs.-strong-vs.-weak-vs.-duck-vs.-structural">Static
vs. Dynamic vs. Strong vs. Weak vs. Duck vs. Structural</h1>
<p>It’s that time of the year where I refresh on some basic computer
science topics.</p>
<h2 id="static-typing">Static typing</h2>
<p><em>examples: c, c++, c#, java</em></p>
<p>Static languages require variable type definitions prior to their
usage. These type definitions are checked at <em>compile time</em>. The
type of an entity resides in the variable.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-typing">Dynamic typing</h2>
<p><em>examples: php, lisp, [Broccoli][broccoli], javascript, perl,
python, ruby, scheme, and smalltalk</em></p>
<p>Dynamic languages apply type definitions as needed. These type
definitions are checked at <em>run time</em>. The type of an entity
resides in the value.</p>
<h2 id="strong-typing">Strong typing</h2>
<p>Claims that a variables and operations can hold only one type of
variable and only one type. There are no implicit conversions.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-break-strong-typing">How to break strong typing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most static languages has some form of casting, which throws the
guarantees of static typing out the window – buying all of the dangers
of dynamic typing, with none of the benefits.<br />
</li>
<li>Automatic type conversion</li>
<li>Variadic functions (???)</li>
<li>Union types</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weak-typing">Weak typing</h2>
<p>Claims that variables and operations can hold compatible types in
addition to the specific type.</p>
<h2 id="duck-typing">Duck typing</h2>
<p>An object is equivalent to another if the relevant pieces are the
same. That is, there is no need to check if object A is of type X; if A
can perform A.quack() at runtime, then it is considered equivalent.</p>
<h2 id="structural-typing">Structural typing</h2>
