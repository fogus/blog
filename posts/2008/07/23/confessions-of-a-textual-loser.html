<h2 id="confession">Confession</h2>
<p>I have tried to write my own text editor. I succeeded, yet
failed.</p>
<h3 id="lame">Lame</h3>
<p>I mean really… who the hell, in this modern day and age, writes their
own text editor?<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Additionally, when said text editor
is written, who the hell writes one with separate <a
href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/intro.html#vim-modes-intro">interaction
modes</a>? Long story short: my editor was a lame clone of the EDT
editor<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> in vogue… well, never.</p>
<h4 id="why">Why?</h4>
<p>I would like to take this moment to write off my sinful ways to
youthful numbskullery. That is, there was a time when I thought that I
<a href="http://twitter.com/fogus/statuses/835954463">shat programmatic
gold</a> and anything written by hacker A could be improved upon by
myself. Why the hell should I use Pico? I could do better than that!
Nano? Gafaw! Emacs? Eight Megabytes and Constantly Swapping! LOL! What a
human buttwipe I <a
href="http://twitter.com/fogus/statuses/866151340">was</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>I suppose it was a nice learning process to write my own editor and
all of that noise<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, but fruit of my labor has left me
wanting… yearning<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. That is, not only do I have a pile
of C code that even Notepad scoffs at, but I have not taken it on myself
to actually learn an editor that <a
href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/">would</a> <a
href="http://www.vim.org/">happily</a>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">urinate</a> all
<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">over</a>
my sad effort. My life would have been better served had I ignored my
inner dickweed and simply learned what the heck a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard">Meta-key</a>
<a href="http://twitter.com/fogus/statuses/866151340">was</a>.</p>
<h4 id="my-continual-lameousity">My continual lameousity</h4>
<p>I have since learned my lesson, scraped my horrible source code<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, and attempted to pick up Emacs.
There is one giant problem however; I am so corrupt with the ways of a
thousand editors, that Emacs confuses the piss out of me. I get along
alright I guess, but I <em>have</em> experienced that awe that most
Emacs n00bs feel whenever they sit down with a true master. That is, my
boss and I sat down recently to hack through some source and I was
astonished to see the way in which he utterly tore through Emacs with
the intensity of a 1000 ninjas on fire – I mean the guy has bucky bits
coursing through his veins. I felt like crying.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Think of it this way: he was fluently speaking Emacs, while I only know
how to say “where is the toilet” and “I are American”. Perhaps this
proficiency comes in time, but damn!</p>
<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</h2>
<p>They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. I’m actually not that
old, but I am certainly mangy. Perhaps there is hope for me yet.
However, I have to be much more systematic about my Emacs education:</p>
<h4 id="live-in-emacs">Live in Emacs</h4>
<p>There is a slight problem here. That is, I do 98% of my work on OSX
boxen and my Emacs of choice is the lickable <a
href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a>. The problem here is that it is
too easy to fall into the old mousey habits<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
this way. Therefore, it might serve to use the command line Emacs
instead, or perhaps burn myself with cigarettes every time I hit Apple-S
instead of Cx-Cs. Need a shell? Mx shell. Need a browser? <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/w3/">W3</a>.</p>
<h4 id="read-about-emacs">Read about Emacs</h4>
<p>My biggest problem with Emacs is that I have very little idea what
it’s capable of. In the months that I have dabbled it appears that <a
href="http://xkcd.com/378/">it can do anything</a>. That knowledge is
not extremely helpful however as I have some practical goals that need
to be addressed (e.g. <a
href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-emacs/">IDE-ness</a>,
<a href="http://orgmode.org/">notetaking</a>, etc…). I have to really
sit down and do some research these issues.</p>
<h4 id="extend-emacs">Extend Emacs</h4>
<p>I had written a <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fogus/2607857873/in/set-72157603453823388/">stupid
little minor mode</a> for my hobby language <a
href="/projects/broccoli">Broccoli</a> and have found the available
references on creating minor/major modes in Emacs much akin to drinking
flaming Bacardi 151<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>… from a firehose. To a n00b,
everyone seems like an expert.</p>
<h4 id="stop-complaining">Stop complaining</h4>
<p>’nuff said.</p>
