<blockquote>
Sometimes found in clear food packaging, #3 PVC, the second most
commonly used plastic in the world, is a toxic plastic dangerous both to
our health and to the environment.

good programmers</a><br/>
<blockquote>
I believe that good developers are always passionate about programming.
Good developers would do some programming even if they weren’t being
paid for it. Good programmers will have a tendency to talk your ear off
about some technical detail of what they’re working on…

Sucks?</a><br/>
<blockquote>
What they all boil down to, in effect, is that some people get immensely
irritated because Rails does not conform to their idea of perfection.

<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/wireless/magazine/16-02/ff_iphone?currentPage=all">On
the iPhone</a><br/>
<blockquote>
For those working on the iPhone, the next three months would be the most
stressful of their careers. Screaming matches broke out routinely in the
hallways. Engineers, frazzled from all-night coding sessions, quit, only
to rejoin days later after catching up on their sleep.

and TeX</a><br/>
<blockquote>
TeX was one of the first major markup languages. The idea was that you’d
write the text of your document, and mixed into the text, you’d include
commands that described how you’d like things to be typeset. Then you’d
run the whole shebang through a TeX processor, and it would generate the
perfectly typeset results.

is not the problem</a><br/>
<blockquote>
People really like the idea of GTD and could definitely see the benefit,
but were really having trouble making it work across the board (at work
as well as at home).

your tests first</a><br/>

When you develop your automated tests first, you know that pretty much
anything important that needs to happen in your program will happen, or
if it doesn’t, at least it will tell you.
