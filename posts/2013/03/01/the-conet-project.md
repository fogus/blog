I discovered [The Conet Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conet_project) many years ago through an old friend from college (thanks P373), and listened to it for many years.  However, I recently (today) found out that the [complete audio of The Conet project is available at Archive.org](http://archive.org/details/ird059).

[Numbers stations](http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/numbers-station-07-31-08) are an infinitely fascinating topic and well worth the exploration.  In celebration of The Conet Project, below you'll find the complete English radio operatorâ€™s alphabet:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Alpha </td><td> Bravo </td><td> Charlie </td><td> Delta </td><td> Echo </td>
