<p>A few years ago I got the idea that it would be fun to implement a
variant of Scheme targeting the JVM. During my search for different ways
to implement numerics I looked deeply at the implementation of two
languages: <a
href="http://jscheme.sourceforge.net/jscheme/main.html">JScheme</a> and
a little-known language <a href="http://www.clojure.org">Clojure</a>.
During my explorations with these two languages and the ways that they
handled and implemented numerics I quickly came to a humbling
realization: there was no possible way that I could make a language as
good as either, and along the way I happened to fall in love with
Clojure. So as a result I completely abandoned my piddly Scheme and
adopted Clojure outright.</p>
<p>However, over the months that followed the time that I had spent in
the interpreter nagged at me. It seemed that perhaps I could use what I
learned to good effect. Rather than attempt to complete the Scheme for
the purposes of use, I instead put together a draft of a single book to
introduce two different topics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Functional programming</li>
<li>Programming language interpretation and compilation</li>
</ol>
<p>This book was intended to use JavaScript to implement a variant of
Scheme piecewise; building a more capable interpreter as the book
progressed. I got as far as re-implementing much of the original
language in JavaScript and completed a fairly detailed outline and a
couple of chapters. However, along the way I got sidetracked on writing
another book called <a href="http://www.joyofclojure.com/buy">The Joy of
Clojure</a> and my JS-Scheme book was derailed.</p>
<p>During my research for the The Joy of Clojure I happened upon a book
called <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Lisp-Small-Pieces-Christian-Queinnec/dp/0521545668/?tag=fogus-20">Lisp
In Small Pieces</a> that simply blew my mind. Aside from the powerful
content itself, the very premise was… wait for it…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to implement a variant of Scheme piecewise; building a more capable
interpreter as the book progressed.</p>
<p>– me, in this blog post, like 7 seconds ago</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, I completely abandoned my JS/Scheme book
idea.</p>
<p>However, over the months that followed the time that I had spent on
the interpreter, outline and chapters nagged at me. It seemed that
perhaps I could use what I learned to good effect. Rather than attempt
to complete the Scheme for the purposes of a book, I instead put
together drafts of <em>two different books to introduce two different
topics</em>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Functional programming</li>
<li>Programming language interpretation and compilation</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of creating a language for the purposes of building an
understanding of functional programming, I could instead write one book
introducing functional programming for a language that could use such a
book and another introducing how and why languages are created the way
that they’re created. About a year and a half ago I started both of
these books, but as it stands only one has managed to come to fruition
so far.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-functional-javascript">Introducing <em>Functional
JavaScript</em></h2>
<p>Through an odd set of circumstances my name, via <a
href="http://ashkenas.com/">Jeremy Ashkenas</a>, found its way onto the
desk of Mary Treseler at <a
href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do">O’Reilly</a> and
I inked a contract to complete my book as an O’Reilly venture:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Functional-JavaScript-Introducing-Programming-Underscore-js/dp/1449360726/?tag=fogus-20"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/funjs-228x300.jpg" alt="funjs" width="228" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5114" /></a></p>
<h2 id="when">When</h2>
<p>As of a month ago the book was effectively complete and is now making
its way through the internal review process.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
<strong>The expected release date is June 2013, but <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Functional-JavaScript-Introducing-Programming-Underscore-js/dp/1449360726/?tag=fogus-20">the
book is available for pre-order from Amazon now</a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>There are many good books on JavaScript that cover, to varying
degrees, functional programming. However, there is a surprising lack of
JavaScript books that tackle the topic full-on. I am an advocate of
functional programming and functional programming techniques, so I think
that there are many lessons from functional programming languages like
Clojure and Haskell that are directly applicable to JavaScript. While
I’m am advocate, I’m fairly non-dogmatic and pragmatic about functional
programming, so I think there is room for a book on the topic that takes
a realistic and fun, yet principled perspective.</p>
<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p>The book uses and builds on the <a
href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore library</a> to highlight and
explain functional programming techniques. It’s not intended as a full
reference to Underscore.js, but is instead about functional programming
in JavaScript. You have to wait for the release to see it all, but a
high-level outline of the chapters is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: Getting started</li>
<li>Chapter 2: First-class functions and applicative programming</li>
<li>Chapter 3: Variable scope and closures</li>
<li>Chapter 4: Higher-order functions</li>
<li>Chapter 5: Function building functions</li>
<li>Chapter 6: Recursion</li>
<li>Chapter 7: Purity, immutability and policies for change</li>
<li>Chapter 8: Flow-based programming</li>
<li>Chapter 9: Programming without class</li>
</ul>
<p>This book has been a long time in the works in some form or another
and I think that despite all of the setbacks getting here, now is the
best time for it to see the light.</p>
<p>I hope that you’ll enjoy.</p>
