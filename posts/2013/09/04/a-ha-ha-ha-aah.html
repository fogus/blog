<p>When I first started using Clojure I was often very confused. My
previous context before finding Clojure was one where things like Java,
an object-oriented mindset and bang-in-place update models reigned. So,
as you can imagine, that Clojure took a very different approach to
modeling time and preferring functional composition seemed to me quite a
hurdle to jump. However, with some perseverance and free-time little
things about Clojure gradually started to make sense. For example, when
I first encountered the <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2009/09/04/understanding-the-clojure-macro/">“threading
macros”</a> <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> I was
mystified. I don’t know why. There was simply a blockage for a day and a
half that I simply couldn’t overcome. However, at the same time I
learned that in Clojure the comma is considered a whitespace
character.</p>
<p><strong>A ha!</strong></p>
<p>That was it! I instantly understood how I could get over my blockage
regarding <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>. That is, I
could just put some commas into the stitch point of the threading macros
to visually show where the flow was occurring from call to call –
something like this:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>(-&gt; (/ 144 12) (/ ,,, 2 3) str keyword list)</code></pre>
<p>But you know what? I did that for about half a day before I stopped
using it. I didn’t need it any more. I had become enlightened in that
tiny way.</p>
<p>Later in my career and long after I had seemingly exhausted my a ha
moments I had the honor and pleasure of working with <a
href="http://stuartsierra.com/">Stuart Sierra</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/brentonashworth">Brenton Ashworth</a> on a
system that would, as it turns out, serve as the spark for some of the
core thinking in <a href="http://pedestal.io/">Pedestal</a>. During that
time I was exploring the idea of <a
href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event
sourcing</a> and felt like I was finally starting to get it when Stuart
and Brenton showed me a part of the system that they were working on
rehydrate its state based on a stream of sequenced events.</p>
<p><strong>Ha ha!</strong></p>
<p>While I had done it before, it was this moment that I really started
looking at systems, rather than just programming languages and
applications through a Clojure-focused lens. You see, event sourcing fit
so neatly with “The Clojure Way” that I should have seen it all along,
but for whatever reason it didn’t click. I suppose looking back on it I
must have always known of the fit, but it didn’t click until that
moment. Programmers, chemists, architects, engineers and physicists
often have these moments of realization punctuated by a laugh. The
mechanism is much the same as that of a joke or likewise a Zen story –
there is a blockage followed by a sudden realization followed by a
laugh.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been working on a project that, to me, is the product
of some long thought focused through a Clojure lens, the culmination of
which has transported me into another frame of reference<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> for
systems building. Whether or not what I’ve created is novel is
irrelevant, I’ve transcended the way that I previously viewed systems –
there’re no turning back, yet all I did was to run some code, view a
console message and say <strong>Aah…</strong></p>
<p>These are the moments that we hope for as programmers. These three
reactions are why we do what we do.</p>

It’s a good read. Alan Kay discusses the same ideas when he occasionally
