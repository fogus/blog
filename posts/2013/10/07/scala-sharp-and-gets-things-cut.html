<p>One of my favorite talks at last month’s <a
href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop conference</a> was <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/08/06/martinodersky-take5-tolist/">Martin
Odersky</a>’s keynote entitled “The Trouble With Types.” There were many
interesting points made in his talk, some that I agree with and some
not. However, I’d like to focus in on a very small, seemingly throwaway
statement made by Dr. Odersky that bothers me. That is, the statement is
one that I see gaining popularity amongst many advocates of static
typing that takes the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m <em>not</em> a great programmer, so static typing helps me to be
a better programmer.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My position is that this statement is incredibly weak, ringing hollow
at best and disingenuous at worst. I don’t know exactly why this phrase
is gaining mind-share, but I suspect it’s an attempt to counter the idea
that strong static type systems like Scala’s are complicated. One reason
that it rings hollow is that anyone can <a
href="http://pizzacompiler.sourceforge.net/">explore the code</a>
written by those who say this phrase and more often than not their skill
is easily apparent.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It’s my opinion that this watered-down phrase needs to die, and
quick. I personally would be more impressed if advocates instead took a
more positive position and stated some to the effect of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I <em>am</em> a great programmer and I choose static type systems
because I demand sharp tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course by taking this position you run the risk of pushing a
fallacious, authority-based angle. However, in the weak or strong case
you’re already <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/01/10/dancing-monkey-gibbers-on-about-scala-and-clojure/">pushing
anecdotes around</a>, so you may at least choose the one that is open
for objective measurement. I’d much rather learn from and participate in
a debate centered around whether Scala is a sharp tool <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
than if Scala makes weak programmers stronger.</p>
<p>Besides if we can come to the agreement that <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/02/scala-is-for-drivers/">Scala
<em>is</em> a sharp tool</a> then the latter point is moot. <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2008/10/20/groovin-with-scala/">Sharp tools
always make everyone better</a> at their craft, regardless of skill
level.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Odersky at about 9.5 minutes into his talk mentions his
experience in using types to constrain the possibilities of his programs
to such an extent that when and if they compile then they tend to be
correct. I’ve experienced this also during my ~3 years with Scala circa
2008 and 2011 and it is incredibly empowering. However, this power did
not come magically, but was instead the result of careful thought and
type design – something that I’ve not seen typically bad programmers
do.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Additionally, that weak phrase immediately provokes the
question: if you’re a not a good programmer then why should I use your
language?<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Does it really need said that <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2009/03/26/baysick-a-scala-dsl-implementing-basic/">sharp
tools can cut the craftsman as well</a>?<a href="#fnref3"
