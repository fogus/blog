<p>I’ve come to the wonderful world of board and card gaming fairly late
in life. While many people were spending days and nights playing <a
href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98/axis-allies">Axis &amp;
Allies</a> or <a
href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15712/egyptian-ratscrew">Egyptian
Ratscrew</a> during their formative years I spent my time either
building little computer games, riding my skateboard or reading. Growing
up I rarely, if ever played board and card games. In fact, I don’t think
that my family owned a single one. That’s not to say that I didn’t
“game” per se, in fact I was deep into <a
href="https://www.wizards.com/dnd/">Dungeons and Dragons</a> <a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for about 10 years – until I went to
college. There were many people at my college who gamed, and I was
probably invited to sessions<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> dozens of times, but for
one reason or another I found myself hiding away in the hidden Linux lab
deep in the dungeons of the Physics building or just hanging with good
friends chatting all night. Interestingly, my previous company <a
href="http://thinkrelevance.com/">Relevance</a> (now Cognitect) had a
very strong gaming culture and I never took advantage of that fact –
silly me.</p>
<p>Recently however, my son discovered the joys of board games through
his after-school program and developed a passion for playing Chess <a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and <a
href="http://www.looneylabs.com/games/fluxx">Fluxx</a>. <a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The
interesting part of his budding passion is that along the way I too have
falling in love with playing games. More to the point, the exquisite
beauty of a well-designed tabletop game is something that I can
appreciate not only as a player, but also as a <a
href="http://fogus.me/fun/">creator</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, I’ve decided to try my hand at creating some games to try
and exercise a mental muscle that I haven’t used in ages – telling a
good story and designing elaborate traps. <a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
Since I am enamored by <a href="https://github.com/fogus">the
open-source coding model</a> I’ve decided to create a few games in
public, eliciting feedback and contributions along the way. <a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I have a few humble ideas already,
<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> so once I have a few spare cycles
I’ll put down some rules and post about my ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Game on.</p>

<li id="fn6"><p>The idea of open-source game design is in no way
original. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of budding game

favorite site for such adventures is one devoted to <a

games</a>. My few initial game ideas are centered around Icehouse parts.
