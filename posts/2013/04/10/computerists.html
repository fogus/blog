<p>How can you tell that someone is <em>not</em> a scientist?</p>
<p>They’ll have the word “scientist” in their title.</p>
<p>This seems harsh right? The truth is that if you look at most of the
fields defining science you’ll see that the practitioners rarely call
themselves scientists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biologist</li>
<li>Chemist</li>
<li>Physicist</li>
<li>Geologist</li>
<li>Astronomer</li>
<li>Botanist</li>
</ul>
<p>So why not call ourselves <em>Computerists</em>? First of all, the
term computerist is akin to calling an astronomer a telescopist. The
deeper problem is that a title like <em>physicist</em> is not merely a
label or a fancy term for the resume. Instead, a physicist is a natural
philosopher who decided to stop goofing off and start applying <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">the scientific
method</a>. Here’s a terse explanation of the scientific method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating
phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating
previous knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So are we, as computer scientists, applying the scientific method?
I’d say in almost every case no since, in my opinion, we generally fail
on every point in the definition above. Humans are fallible, illusory,
coping animals. You take a human and put them almost anywhere on planet
earth and they will adapt, cope and survive. However, the only thing
that separates us from shaved apes is our ability to reflect on our
nature and do something about it. In fact, the scientific method is
extraordinarily useful in breaking our natural habit of coping by
shining a spotlight on the B.S. that we’ve conveniently chosen to
ignore.</p>
<p>However, as computerists we celebrate our coping mechanisms to the
extreme. We can take the worst operating system in the world and somehow
manage to get something done by adjusting. We can slog through the most
brain-dead of programming languages by hacking in features that make it
“just work” and convincing ourselves that we’ve done something amazing.
For every new programming language we reinvent techniques that were
discovered in the 60s and before. The reward? Top ranking blog posts and
consultant fees.</p>
<p>Are we having fun? Probably.</p>
<p>Are we getting things done? Sometimes.</p>
<p>Are we scientists? No.</p>
<p>Do we care?</p>
