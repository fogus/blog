<p>Recently there was a wonderful post call “<a
href="http://www.dev.gd/20130122-the-joys-of-having-a-forever-project.html">The
joys of having a forever project</a>” that was very motivational and got
a lot of people excited. Due to that post I went searching around and
found a whole under-culture of forever projects on the Internet
including a <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programmingforever/">SubReddit devoted to
the topic</a>. While I can understand the draw of a forever project,<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve tended toward projects with an
end; divided into chunks of 5, 3, 1 and 1/2 year timeframes. Whenever I
approach an exciting opportunity I try to imagine it as falling into one
of the four bins. This allows me to avoid chasing every shiny object
that comes my way – an urge that I have far too often.</p>
<h2 id="section">5</h2>
<p>A little over five years ago I wanted to start on a 5-year project. A
5-year project is exactly what you think it is; something complicated
enough to take five years to complete. At the time I decided to create a
variant of Scheme and had I continued doing so I’m certain that, five
years later, the world would have yet another crappy Scheme variant. I
started my Scheme (named Broccoli) in earnest fully expecting to take
five years to do it well enough to be proud.</p>
<p>Little did I expect that five years later I would have instead helped
further the cause of a very different variant of Scheme/Lisp – <a
href="http://www.clojure.org">Clojure</a>. Looking back on my five year
goal of five years hence I clearly did not accomplish my goal, but I
think that I gave more to the world than if I had. Five year projects
are funny that way; they can flail, go completely off the rails, they
can morph and sometimes they can turn into lifetime projects. My
five-year project morphed, and thankfully for the best.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>While I plan to continue working with and for Clojure, I’m kinda on
the hunt for another five-year project. I have a few ideas, but who
knows what they’ll look like in 2018. I’m sure that I’ll blog about it
along the way.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">3</h2>
<p>A three-year project is more difficult to deal with and is long
enough and ponderous enough to conflict with a concurrent five-year
project. My work on <a
href="https://www.github.com/clojure/core.contracts">core.contracts</a>
is close to a three-year project, but I’ve been a bit wishy-washy on it
and it should be further ahead than it actually is. Something that I
would have been proud to have started three-years ago is something like
<a
href="https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/0.1.0/underscore.js">Underscore.js</a>,
<a href="http://aphyr.github.io/riemann/">Riemann</a> or <a
href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> – a relevant library or system that
many people find useful and generally kicks butt. I’ve managed to
release some useful libraries for sure, but I’d hardly consider them
three-year projects.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I have a very nice plan for a
three-year project that shouldn’t conflict with anything else, but only
time will tell.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="section-2">1</h2>
<p>One-year projects are the simplest to manage because of their shorter
time-frame. Likewise, I’ve found that they’re often easy to parallelize
with other one-year projects, but that may be because I pick projects in
different realms. For example, in the past few years some of my 1-year
projects have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a <a href="http://www.joyofclojure.com">Clojure book</a></li>
<li>Listen to everything that Béla Bartók ever composed <a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
<li>Write a <a href="http://www.functionaljavascript.com">book on
functional programming</a> (ongoing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing earth-shattering for sure, but they’re intentionally
digestible, yet satisfying. I have a couple of one-year projects that
are closing out, and once again on the hunt. I recently (re)discovered
the joys of compression and algorithmic information theory and it would
easily take a year to become even a rank amateur on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">0.5</h2>
<p>Half-year projects could be anything from reading a good book to a
creating a well-documented software library or service to writing a
poem. My half-year projects are too numerous and disposable to mention,
but I will say that a couple that I’m excited to get into whenever I’m
done with my book projects are to <em>thoroughly</em> read both <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744/?tag=fogus-20">AMOP</a>
and <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Programming/dp/0262220695/?tag=fogus-20">CTM</a>.</p>
<p>But of course there are infinitely many projects to be done at any
given time, so how do you (well, me) choose which ones to work on? I
think <a href="http://sivers.org/hellyeah">Derek Sivers said it
best</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No more yes. It’s either HELL YEAH! or no.</p>
