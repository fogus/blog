Last year I made a vow to myself that I would not give any talks in 2013 without showing code.  What that really means is that any talk that I would give in 2013 had to be related to a project that I was actively working on and had working source code.  The first half of the year was empty partially because I didn't have much to show, but mostly because the projects that I planned to talk about were not interesting enough to talk about,[^rej] but I have a couple talks coming up before the end of the year.

### The Shape of Functional Programming (NationJS)

On [October 4, 2013 I'll be giving a talk about functional programming in JavaScript at NationJS](http://www.nationjs.com/).  The talk will be about functional programming in general, using [Underscore-contrib](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib) as the vehicle.  This talk will be geared for people with very little exposure to FP.

### Zeder (Clojure Conj)

Zeder is a Clojure library that I've been working on for about a year and I've gotten it to the point where I can talk about it.[^by]  My talk proposal [on Zeder was accepted to the Clojure/Conj happening on Nov 14-16, 2013](http://clojure-conj.org/), so I'm very excited to show what I've been doing.  Without going into too much detail, a TL;TR for a segment of my planned talk is: *production-rule system as a value*. 

I hope to see you at these events.

:F

[^rej]: Nor be accepted.

[^by]: Well, by then anyway.
