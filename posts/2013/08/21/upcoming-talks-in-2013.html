<p>Last year I made a vow to myself that I would not give any talks in
2013 without showing code. What that really means is that any talk that
I would give in 2013 had to be related to a project that I was actively
working on and had working source code. The first half of the year was
empty partially because I didn’t have much to show, but mostly because
the projects that I planned to talk about were not interesting enough to
talk about,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but I have a couple talks coming up
before the end of the year.</p>
<h3 id="the-shape-of-functional-programming-nationjs">The Shape of
Functional Programming (NationJS)</h3>
<p>On <a href="http://www.nationjs.com/">October 4, 2013 I’ll be giving
a talk about functional programming in JavaScript at NationJS</a>. The
talk will be about functional programming in general, using <a
href="https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib">Underscore-contrib</a>
as the vehicle. This talk will be geared for people with very little
exposure to FP.</p>
<h3 id="zeder-clojure-conj">Zeder (Clojure Conj)</h3>
<p>Zeder is a Clojure library that I’ve been working on for about a year
and I’ve gotten it to the point where I can talk about it.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> My
talk proposal <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">on Zeder was accepted
to the Clojure/Conj happening on Nov 14-16, 2013</a>, so I’m very
excited to show what I’ve been doing. Without going into too much
detail, a TL;TR for a segment of my planned talk is: <em>production-rule
system as a value</em>.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at these events.</p>
