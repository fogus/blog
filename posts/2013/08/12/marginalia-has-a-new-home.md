A few days ago I [posted that I was looking for a new home for Marginalia](http://blog.fogus.me/2013/08/07/marginalia-needs-a-home/) and today I am happy to say that I have found one.  [Gary Deer](https://github.com/gdeer81) has graciously agreed to take the reins and push Marginalia in new and exciting directions.

Two projects fall under the Marginalia banner:

1. Marginalia <https://www.github.com/gdeer81/marginalia>
2. lein-marginalia <https://www.github.com/gdeer81/lein-marginalia>

Both of these projects now reside in Gary's Github account and he is the person to contact should you have questions.  I will still help however I can, but Gary is the man with the plan moving forward.

Thank you Gary and thanks to everyone who has contributed and used Marginalia over the past few years.

:F
