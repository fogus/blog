As an attempt to branch out with my writing, I've taken to working on various fiction and non-fiction pieces. In the latter category I just had a guest-post published at one of my favorite literary blogs [Wormwoodania](https://wormwoodiana.blogspot.com). The post is about a little bit of private "Corvine" research that I did last year at Georgetown University.

Enjoy!
