<p>Via the <a href="http://blog.typesafe.com/rip-phil-bagwell">Typesafe
blog I learned that Phil Bagwell recently passed away</a>. I met Phil at
the 2011 Clojure Conj and had the absolute pleasure to wine and dine
with him during the course of the weekend. Four things stand out to me
from that time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>He had an amazing sense of humor. I was a bit intimidated in
meeting him, but was soon put at ease by his friendly demeanor and
willingness to crack a hilarious joke in a flawless deadpanned manner.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>His grasp of algorithmic complexity and data structures was
staggering. In fact, his work defining <a
href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf">HAMTs</a> <a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> has been a constant source of
inspiration, not only for myself, but for data structure research in
general and specifically in implementation within <a
href="http://www.clojure.org">Clojure</a>, <a
href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a>, and <a
href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>. These languages and their
users owe Phil a great debt of gratitude for his pioneering work. It’s
on us to learn<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> from his valuable lessons and make
something of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Although he probably knew more about functional data structures
than anyone else in the room, he took pains to describe his work as
“dabbling” and “a hobby”. His modesty was disarming and
inspiring.</p></li>
<li><p>He talked very silently. However, because the people around him
feared missing his wisdom, you would often see a crowd of people leaning
in toward him as to not miss a syllable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I will cherish those hours spent talking with him. I am saddened that
the chance to converse with him again is gone, but mostly I’m saddened
for his family, co-workers and computer science at large. We’ve lost an
amazing individual.</p>
<p>Thank you Phil.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>When I introduced myself to him he immediately shot
back, “You’re the one who created <a

he knew of my piss-take and likewise appreciated it as such.<a
