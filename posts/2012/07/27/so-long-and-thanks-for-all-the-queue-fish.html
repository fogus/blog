<p>Today I say goodbye to <a
href="http://www.thinkrelevance.com">Relevance Inc.</a> and <a
href="http://www.clojure.com">Clojure/core</a>.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Next week I start a new adventure in programming. As many of you may
have experienced, leaving a job that you enjoy, populated by brilliant
people, provokes a strange mix of emotions. If you work at a job that
you enjoy, populated with brilliant people, then why would you ever
leave? I’ve thought long and hard about this very question and there is
probably no answer other than - it’s personal.</p>
<p>I gently withdrew from a career in AI<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
five years ago to explore the world of the web more deeply and have
accumulated a fair amount of bruises along the way. From full time
web-related client work in Rails and Clojure to my modest contributions
to <a href="http://www.datomic.com">Datomic</a> and <a
href="http://www.github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> I
feel that I’ve contributed to pushing the state of the art forward -
even if my contributions were a mere nudge. However, I feel that I’ve
learned enough about web-development to realize that I’m not the person
to tackle the burning problems of the web at this time. Therefore, I’ve
decided to refocus my career on a field that I know fairly well and feel
that I can offer fresh-perspectives to.</p>
<p>Helping to push the state of programming language design forward was
always a primary goal when I chose to contribute to Clojure and
ClojureScript via <a href="http://www.github.com/fogus">code</a>, <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/tag/clojure+clojurescript">blogging</a>,
talks and even a <a href="http://www.joyofclojure.com">book</a>.
Removing myself from the forefront of Clojure-related development pains
me because I believe that Clojure, ClojureScript and Datomic are poised
to change the computing industry both directly and via influence.
However, as I move on I have every intention to continue contributing to
and benefiting from them. I thus move from a stewardship role to one of
a contributor, but the beauty of open source is that each role is
important in its own way.</p>
<p>Since joining Relevance and Clojure/core I’ve worked with amazing
people and true experts in design<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, architecture<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, Rails,<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
Clojure,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> web development,<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
project management<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and programming language and
database design and implementation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In no other span of my
career have I learned more than during my ~17 months with Relevance and
Clojure/core. I will strive to take the lessons learned, internalize
them, apply my own spin and help to grow a company and if I’m truly
lucky, a field.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Clojure/core holds a meeting every Friday to discuss
Clojure, ClojureScript, Datomic and every relevant topic under the sun.
Of all the things that I will miss in leaving Relevance, I will miss
these meetings the most.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Specifically, my AI focus has been in distributed
simulation, computer vision and expert systems.<a href="#fnref2"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>After working with Relevance’s talented designers
Michael Parenteau, Jen Myers and Kevin Altman I can’t imagine finding
satisfaction in my old jacked-up developer-oriented interfaces.<a
href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>After working with the likes of Tim Ewald, Russ Olsen
and Michael Nygard, I have a new appreciation for the art of
architecture. In my prior experience the architect role typically
prompted derision from developers. However, after working with these
three gentlemen I must say that what they do and what the architects
I’ve worked with in the past do is <strong>something else
entirely</strong>. The only analogy that I have is that prior to my
first trip to Japan I had only ever had sushi from local DC restaurants.
However, during my trip I had sushi in a town named Otaru and compared
to the “local sushi” … well, there was no comparison. Even though they
had the same name, the fact of the matter was that they were not the
same food at all. Good architects are like top of the line sushi. One
goal in making my change is to get hands-on experience in architectural
thinking. Working with, and engaging in discussions with these three
gentlemen have shown me that I have a long way to go. Working with these
three gentlemen has driven the future course of my career like no other
influence so far (save for my first Lisp professor). Good architectural
thinking requires more than just book-learning… it’s a frame of
reference gained through experience and thoughtfulness – identifying
this was eye-opening. I don’t know if I “have what it takes”, but I’m
determined to find out.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Prior to joining Relevance I had very little prior
experience with Rails. However, my outsider’s view of Rails was less
than favorable. However, in the hands of masters like Rob Sanheim, Jamie
Kite, Chad Humphries and Clinton Dreisbach Rails is an extremely sharp
tool. I was at once both enlightened and humbled.<a href="#fnref5"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>What can I say about the Clojurians at Relevance except
that it was my pleasure to learn even more than I thought possible from
the developers molding the language and its usage patterns. It was an
absolute pleasure being the worst Clojure programmer in the room.<a
href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>While working with the likes of Alex Redington, Sam
Umbach, Brenton Ashworth[^bre] and Jason Rudolph I gained an
appreciation for (and fear of) the intricate subtleties of web
development. To see them work is to wonder how any human can know such a
hostile environment in such depth and create amazing tech in spite of
it.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Relevance has a (somewhat) libertine’s view of
management and management structures, but by gum it works! It’ll take a
long time before I understand what makes Justin Gehtland, Muness
Alrubaie, Marc Phillips and Maggie Litton highly effective managers –
whatever it is I lack it, and I want it.<a href="#fnref8"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Datomic is the most amazing system that I have ever had
the pleasure to participate in. The lessons learned (and yet learned) in
watching Rich Hickey and Stu Halloway build this amazing system keep me
up at night. I look forward to using Datomic as it grows, but I will
miss watching two masters at work. Should I achieve a tenth of their
ability, insight and vision then I will consider mine a worthy career.<a
href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>But this is all about career stuff which is fine and
good for sure, but I have no intentions on changing this blog nor any of
my other worldwide personalities. There are more inanities, programming
language ponderings, goofy images, dry presentations and hot air to
come. Stay tuned!<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
