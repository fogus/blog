<p>Why do people have trouble reading books? The primary answer you’re
likely to receive when asking this question is that reading is boring.
And to this response I agree. Reading is boring - but it doesn’t need to
be boring. The reason that reading is boring is that many people view
their relationship to reading in a somewhat black and white manner. For
example, think of a book you’ve read recently. What were your goals in
choosing to read that book? For many people the answer is of the
form:</p>
<ul>
<li>To read every single word</li>
<li>Remember everything</li>
</ul>
<p>If these goals were even possible<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> then reading would very
often be extremely boring. How would you handle a book that just isn’t
well written? It would be painful to read every word. What about a book
that is complicated or uses language that you’re not familiar with? In
this case the act of remembering everything would slow your reading
speed to a crawl. What if you read a book that is complicated, uses
unfamiliar language and is not well written? Most people slog through
the first 100 pages or so<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> then forget about the book, read it
off and on from time to time, forget what they’ve read and ultimately
give up and think that reading is boring. And they’re right. Reading
like this <strong>is</strong> boring! Not only is it boring, but it’s
oppressive. How does it feel to constantly see that book mocking you
from your desk? Not great. The best solution in this case is to simply
stop trying to read that book. Go out and find a <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/World-War-Oral-History-Zombie/dp/0307888681/?tag=fogus-20">zombie
novel</a> or something else mostly fun and non-challenging to cleanse
the palate so to speak. The problem is that many people have a hard time
doing this because they feel like they’ve invested valuable time already
and didn’t meet their inaccessible goals. You’re not a failure if you
give up on a book - you just didn’t like it.</p>
<p>Sadly I do not have a cure-all solution to this problem. However, I
can explain my approach to reading that is summarized as simply
“establishing a relationship with your book”. The act of establishing a
relationship with a book for me is to think of the following, before
starting to read:</p>
<ul>
<li>My goals in reading the book - I guarantee they never look like the
goals listed above.</li>
<li>When will I read the book? I talked about <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2012/02/22/reading/">reading contexts</a>
previously.</li>
<li>How can I supplement the book? For example, are there any blogs that
discuss the book that I can reference during or after reading it?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a very personal system, so let me outline an example below.</p>
<h2 id="extreme-reading">Extreme reading</h2>
<p>I recently read Kent Beck’s book <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Edition/dp/0321278658/?tag=fogus-20">Extreme
Programming Explained: Embrace Change</a></em>. The twist to this story
is that I’ve worked at <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com">Relevance</a>
for over a year and it is indeed an “agile shop.” So what was the point
of my reading Beck’s book? As it turns out I had two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beck is an excellent technical writer and I am extremely jealous of
his ability and I want to write like him when I grow up.</li>
<li>Even though I’ve worked at an agile shop for a year, I’ve yet to
truly reflect on my experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s all. Did I achieve my goals?</p>
<p>Goal #1 was a no-brainer - read Beck, learn how to write more gooder.
Goal #2 was met, but some of what I read was not directly applicable to
my daily work-life. That’s OK though, because in reading Beck’s book I
enhanced my “agile lexicon” and this fact may prove useful in the
future. I tended to read the book in the morning before work so that I
could have fresh ideas when pairing with my co-workers and chat about
them as time allowed.</p>
<p>It took me two days to read the book and I’ve thought about it and
talked about it ever since. I’d say that was a very rewarding
experience, but not life changing. All of my reading experiences will
not be the same, every book is different, and so every relationship will
be likewise.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
