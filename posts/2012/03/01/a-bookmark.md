In my [last post on reading](http://blog.fogus.me/2012/02/22/reading/) I mentioned that I like to take notes while reading to help crystalize my understanding.  Here's how I take notes.

My bookmark is my note-taking device.

It's a [Moleskine Cahier](http://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Plain-Cahier-Journal-Pocket/dp/8883704940/?tag=fogus-20) plain notebook.  It's very thin and works pretty well to mark my page in most sized books.  Moleskine also offers a smaller sized notebook, the [Volant](http://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Volant-Notebook-Plain-Pocket/dp/8883708598/?tag=fogus-20) that might work even better, but I've yet to try one.

I simply write notes as I go.

And put words needing definition or that I want to remember in the back.  

Simple.

:F
