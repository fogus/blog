<p><em>this is the fourth entry in an n-part <a

<p>When <a
href="http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> was
first announced there was much gnashing of teeth over the fact that it
provided neither <code>eval</code>, nor runtime macros. In response, I
did <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/07/29/compiling-clojure-to-javascript-pt-2-why-no-eval/">tackle
the matter of <code>eval</code></a>, but code speaks louder than words,
so I therefore present <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/himera">Himera</a>, a ClojureScript
compilation web-service.</p>
<p>I have a deployment of <a
href="http://himera.herokuapp.com/index.html">Himera on Heroku</a>
(shown below – caveat emptor) if you’d like to play with it.
Additionally, the <a href="http://github.com/fogus/himera">Himera source
code is available on Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-himera-is">What Himera is</h2>
<p>Himera<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> (Russian: Химера, pronounced
Hee-mera with a trill) is an experiment in slicing and dicing the
typical REPL model of Lisp computation, providing a modularized web
service for ClojureScript compilation.</p>
<h2 id="repl">REPL</h2>
<p>Lisps, and Clojure is no exception, provide a unique programming
experience via the REPL. The canonical representation of the REPL
described as source is summarized simply as:</p>
<pre><code>(loop (print (eval (read))))</code></pre>
<p>You’ve probably seen this contrivance, but what exactly does it mean?
The diagram below is a graphical representation of the same idea:</p>
<figure>

title="REPL 10000ft" alt="repl-vanilla" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">repl-vanilla</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That is, a REPL is a composition of three repeating functions:
<code>read</code>, <code>eval</code>, and <code>print</code>. The read
step takes a string (or maybe an input buffer) and produces a Lisp data
structure representing the program in hand<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
This data structure is then fed into the <code>eval</code> function and
executed as a program. Finally, the result of the evaluation step
(another Lisp data structure) is printed to the user.</p>
<p>This model of the REPL is highly simplistic, but it serves as
representational for most cases. However, because of a lot of historical
baggage, the typical conception of this model is often limited to that
of a single process, as in the image below:</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">repl-1-proc</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But this is an outmoded ideal, whether it be at a console REPL:</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">repl-phone</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It simply does not need to be configured in such a way. The very
nature of Lisp and its furcated architecture allows many different ways
to arrange the components of a REPL.</p>
<h2 id="an-exploded-view-of-the-repl">An exploded view of the REPL</h2>
<p>Before I can talk about various ways to slice up the REPL into bits
and pieces I should mention that the canonical image above is way too
simplistic. Instead, the ClojureScript compiler is modularized along
much finer dimensions than the Lispy trinity. Observe the following:</p>
<figure>
<img

title="ClojureScript&#39;s compiler anatomy"
alt="cljs-compiler-anatomy" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">cljs-compiler-anatomy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The constituent parts of the ClojureScript anatomy are as
follows:</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>Some input device reads a string of characters and feeds it into the
reader as a true string datatype or some input buffer.</p>
<h3 id="reader">Reader</h3>
<p>The reader consumes the string from the input device and transforms
it into a Clojure data structure. In other words, the raw string:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;(vector :thx (-&gt; 1138 - str))&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Is converted into a Clojure persistent list data structure of three
elements: 1) the symbol <code>vector</code>, 2) the keyword
<code>:thx</code>, and 3) another persistent list of three elements a
symbol <code>-&gt;</code>, <code>1138</code>, a symbol <code>-</code>
and another symbol <code>str</code>. The source view of this data
structure is described in Clojure as:</p>
<pre><code>(list &#39;vector :thx (list &#39;-&gt; 1138 &#39;- &#39;str))</code></pre>
<p>The result of the Reader is always a Clojure data structure, Java
instance, or an error.</p>
<h3 id="macro-expansion-macro-xp">Macro expansion (macro-xp)</h3>
<p>The raw Clojure data structures produced by the Reader are then
processed for macro-expansion to some fixed point (i.e. they are
expanded until the input equals the output). In the case of the
structure listed above, the macro <code>-&gt;</code> would be expanded
into the following:</p>
<pre><code>(vector :thx (str (- 1138)))</code></pre>
<p>This is where Clojure’s idea of (and Lisp in general) code as data
diverges from the syntactic representation.</p>
<h3 id="analyzer">Analyzer</h3>
<p>The analysis phase of ClojureScript compilation builds an abstract
syntax tree (AST) that represents the program itself, divorced from
syntactic matters. That is, the tree structure defines logical groupings
along branches, binding contexts alongs tree depth, etc. This is where
Clojure’s (and Lisp in general) code as data diverges from its parse
form. The analysis phase also marks the end of the the first phase in
ClojureScript’s 2-phase compilation process.</p>
<h3 id="emitter">Emitter</h3>
<p>This is where ClojureScript’s AST is walked and transformed into
JavaScript. This is the beginning and end of the second phase of
ClojureScript’s 2-phase compilation process. This is also where you
would typically deploy your ClojureScript application. However, in the
context of a REPL layout, two more elements are missing.</p>
<h3 id="eval-or-runtime">Eval (or runtime)</h3>
<p>The JavaScript that is produced by the ClojureScript compiler is
evaluated. The original code <code>(vector :thx (str (- 1138)))</code>
under examination above would result in what in Clojure would look like
the following:</p>
<pre><code>[:thx &quot;-1138&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>However, it would be JavaScript and therefore an instance of
<code>cljs.core.Vector</code> containing two strings.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="print">Print</h3>
<p>The result of the JavaScript is “printed” via the appropriate
means.</p>
<p>Taking this exploded view of the ClojureScript compiler to heart,
imagine how the traditional REPL model might look differently under
various operational constraints. Below I will illustrate a few.</p>
<h2 id="the-browser-connected-repl">The Browser-connected REPL</h2>
<p>Because ClojureScript has neither runtime evaluation nor compilation
elements, the <a href="http://clojure.com">Clojure/core</a> team had to
devise a way to provide an agile development experience that Clojure
programmers were accustomed to. The initial release of ClojureScript
packaged <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> and used it
as the evaluation engine of the emitted JavaScript, however, this was
less than optimal for numerous reasons outside of the scope of this
post. Eventually, it was decided that the evaluation engine should
instead be that of a browser, as shown below:</p>
