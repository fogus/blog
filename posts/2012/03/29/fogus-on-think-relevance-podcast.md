I couple weeks ago [Craig Andera](http://twitter.com/craigandera) interviewed me for the [Relevance podcast](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/tags/podcast). I have been with [Relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com) for a year and in this podcast I talk a bit about its culture, pairing, ClojureScript, [Himera](http://himera.heroku.com), [reading](), and zombies.[^z]

[Listen to my rambling on the Relevance podcast](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2012/03/28/thinkrelevance-the-podcast-episode-008-michael-fogus).

[^par]: The podcast "album cover" was designed by the inimitable [Michael Parenteau](http://michaelparenteau.com/).

[^z]: I scaled back on the zombie talk, but I seriously could have gone on for 45 minutes. If any zombie-related podcasts are interested in an interview on the subject then contact me ... before it's too late!
