It's a proud day as my colleagues Rich Hickey, Stuart Halloway, and others at [Relevance, Inc.](http://thinkrelevance.com) have announced [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com) -- a new kind of database.  I wouldn't give due justice in describing what Datomic provides now, so I recommend viewing the video by Rich below to get the summary.

Follow that with an introduction to Datalog and Datomic querying by Stuart Halloway:

A [Datomic VM appliance and peer are available](http://datomic.com/product/download) for those of you interested in trying it out.  This is [something very new](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3667280) and it will take some time to spread the relevant knowledge.  I promise to serve my part in this by sharing some Datomic-related blog posts soon.
