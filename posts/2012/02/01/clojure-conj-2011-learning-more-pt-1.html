<p>By my measure, the <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">second Clojure
Conj</a> was a smashing success. I wrote summaries of the <a
href="http://clojure.com/blog/2011/11/17/second-conj.html">mainline Conj
activities</a> and the <a
href="http://clojure.com/blog/2011/11/17/second-conj.html">unconference
activities</a> if you need some context. The amount of brain power on
tap at the conference was intoxicating. In an attempt to present a feel
for the topics of discussion in the lecture hall and hallways I’ll post
with links to posts, papers, presentations, and tidbits of information
for learning more.</p>
<p>I’ve limited the scope of this post to cover only the <a
href="http://clojure.com/blog/2012/01/31/first-conj-2011-videos-available.html">initial
released talks</a>, but as more are released so too will I post
more.</p>
<h3 id="learning-clojure---next-steps">Learning Clojure - Next
Steps</h3>
<p><a href="http://stuartsierra.com/">Stuart Sierra</a> started the
conference with a talk about pushing <a
href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> and <a
href="http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a>
further, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extending the Clojure reader</li>
<li>Using Clojure from Java</li>
<li>Using the JVM’s base concurrency primitives</li>
<li>Using Clojure’s rich data-structures instead of JSON</li>
<li>And others…</li>
</ul>

<p>From this talk there are a couple of interesting follow ups at your
disposal. First, the idea of using Clojure’s rich data formats as a
replacement for JSON was a topic of discussion during my DevIgnition
talk on December 2nd, 2011 entitled *<a
href="http://www.slideshare.net/fogus/codedata">Code as data as
code</a>. The slides are only partially helpful, but I hope that a video
will be available soon. In any case I will likely explore this idea in a
later post. Second, the idea of an extensible Clojure reader via tagged
literals was discussed deeper in Rich Hickey’s keynote at the Conj and
is currently <a
href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Tagged+Literals">under
design</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L6569">implementation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="concurrent-stream-processing">Concurrent Stream Processing</h3>
<p>While Clojure’s official <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/forkjoin.html">fork-join</a>
story is incomplete, David’s talk discusses Revelytix’s approach to
concurrent data stream processing in their query processing engine. With
a bevy of nice images, he walked through the high-level architecture of
a system designed to combine large data streams as one might <a
href="http://doc.cat-v.org/unix/pipes/">connect the ends of hoses</a>.
Related to this point, and of critical importance to Clojure, is the
focus on leveraging topnotch Java libraries in achieving their goals.
The near-seamless Java interop in Clojure is an incredible boon to
companies and individuals using Clojure in their projects.</p>

<p>One of the interesting aspects of David’s talk was his discussion of
how he and his team discovered ways to improve the design of their
system, specifically how they might refactor <a
href="http://clojure.org/protocols">protocols</a> to split orthogonal
concerns. This kind of thought-process and its benefits was recently
summarized beautifully <a
href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3515862">by Steve Losh on
Hacker News</a>.</p>
<h3 id="clojail">Clojail</h3>
<p>Anthony’s talk on his <a
href="https://github.com/Raynes/clojail">Clojail</a> library that
provides a sandboxed environment for Clojure execution has a long and
storied precedent. For example, <a
href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Sandboxed_Evaluation.html">Racket’s
sandboxing capability</a> is at least superficially very similar to
Clojail. However, Racket’s runtime security mechanism called <a
href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/eval-model.html#(part._custodian-model)">Custodians</a>
are very different from the JVM model absorbed by Clojail, although the
goals for each are similar.</p>

<embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#AYLpqEwC" style="display:none">
</embed>
<p>Before Racket (and PLT-Scheme on which it’s built) there was some
research an implementation for <a
href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">Scheme48 of a
security kernel by Jonathan Rees called W7</a>.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The
approach of W7 is quite breathtaking and there may be some lessons to
take away for Clojail itself.</p>
<h3 id="clojurescript">ClojureScript</h3>
<p>Chouser’s presentation on ClojureScript was given on a nifty little
piece of presentation software written in ClojureScript named <a
href="https://github.com/Chouser/talk-cljs">Traction</a>. This is just
an interesting aside.</p>
<h4 id="data-structures">Data structures</h4>
<p>In his talk he talked about how ClojureScript’s data structures are
currently copy-on-write, mimicking Clojure’s behavior below a certain
threshold. Reading over Clojure’s implementation of <a
href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/PersistentVector.java#L170">PersistentVector</a>
and <a
href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/PersistentHashMap.java#L536">PersistentHashMap</a>
provides some insight into this approach.</p>

<h4 id="protocols-and-types">Protocols and types</h4>
<p>Clojure’s approach for implementing types and protocols is built on
the <a
href="http://bolinfest.com/javascript/inheritance.php">pseudo-classical</a>
inheritance pattern that stands in contrast to the <a
href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html">functional
inheritance pattern</a> espoused by Douglas Crockford. Crockford’s
pattern isn’t exactly Crockford’s pattern at all, but instead has a rich
history. Some interesting implementations using this pattern to create
class-based OO models include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/pure-oo-system.scm">Oleg’s
purely functional OO library for Scheme</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1482348">Bryan O’Sullivan’s BOS for
Scheme48</a></li>
<li>Chouser and I talk briefly about this approach in section 7.2 of
<em><a href="http://joyofclojure.com">The Joy of Clojure</a></em></li>
<li>and many many more…</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extending-javascript-libraries-from-clojurescript">Extending
JavaScript Libraries from ClojureScript</h3>
<p>I enjoyed Kevin’s talk very much as his humor and wit shone through
in his talk. Kevin’s company <a href="http://keminglabs.com/">Keming
Labs</a> was one of the earliest adopters of ClojureScript and his talk
focused on how they used it, how it helped them succeed, and some of its
painful aspects. Specifically, he focused on the use of the <a
href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">D3 JavaScript data visualization
library</a> via ClojureScript interop.</p>

<embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#AYLpqHIC" style="display:none">
</embed>
<p>In addition to a nice talk, he and his company put together a <a
href="http://keminglabs.com/talks/conj_2011/handout.pdf">ClojureScript
pamphlet</a> that although a bit outdated at the moment<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is
still a useful reference. Since his talk ClojureScript has matured
thanks in no small part to his own efforts and comments.</p>
<h3 id="tune-in-next-time">Tune in next time</h3>
<p>There are more Conj 2011 videos due for release soon, so I will try
to keep up as they are released.</p>
