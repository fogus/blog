<p>People sometimes ask me how I’m able to read 70+ books every year
despite <a href="http://github.com/fogus">my extra-curricular</a>, <a
href="http://clojure.com">professional</a>, and <a
href="http://joyofclojure.com">authoring</a> activities. The truth is
that although my reading count the past few years has remained fairly
consistent, it’s far less than my historical count (by half) and
pathetically less than truly prolific readers<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Alas, people ask and so I’ll try to answer the best that I can. Below
you’ll find a short list of principles that help me to maximize my
reading time and motivation.</p>
<h3 id="read-only-what-you-find-interesting">Read only what you find
interesting</h3>
<p>This seems self-evident, but many people: 1) have no idea what they
find interesting, or 2) feel that what they find interesting is childish
or lowbrow. That may be the case, but who cares? The point of reading is
to enjoy reading. No one can tell you what you should enjoy reading, so
read what you enjoy. I believe that as time passes your interests will
expand into other kinds of writing, but even if that never happens it’s
not terribly important.</p>
<p>If the book you’re reading is too embarrassing to carry onto the
subway then find something else to do on the subway, or buy a <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wi-Fi-Ink-Display-Screensavers/dp/B0051QVESA/?tag=fogus-20">Kindle</a>.
All books look the same in the Kindle.</p>
<h3 id="be-willing-to-abandon-bad-books">Be willing to abandon bad
books</h3>
<p>Like many people I feel physical pain when reading a bad book.
Likewise, there is a relative “point of no return” for each reader
where, when reading a bad book, they will feel that the time and pain
spent is too costly to abandon the effort. Fight that urge because there
is nothing less conducive to prolific reading than trying to slog
through a bad book.</p>
<h3 id="read-in-context">Read in context</h3>
<p>I tend to read 3-4 books at a time. It was once difficult to keep the
“story lines” straight in my head when switching from one book to
another, but I found that context helps solve that problem. For example,
I read a certain book before bed while I read a different book in the
morning and yet a different book for study. I hope you get the point.
The goal is to contextualize certain books (or even genres) so that my
mind is ready for certain content at certain times. However, do not
stick to this partitioning too strictly as truly great books smash
through the contexts and I find myself unable to put them down. Roll
with this. There are few things more joyful then finding a truly great
book.</p>
<h3 id="the-more-you-read-the-faster-youll-read">The more you read the
faster you’ll read</h3>
<p>It’s true. Reading is practice for your reading speed and vocabulary.
The more you read the faster the words will flow past your eyes and the
less time you’ll need to spend in the dictionary. I still religiously
check the dictionary for words that I’m unfamiliar with and are
important to understanding the narrative. However, for words that are
interesting but inessential (it’s hard to know which words fall into
this category, but you’ll learn to identify them over time) I write them
down and look them up at my leisure.</p>
<h3 id="take-notes">Take notes</h3>
<p>This is related to the point above. That is, by keeping notes you can
go back later and explore certain aspects closer and more deeply. This
will help you by simply learning more and this fact will help you
pre-load information for future books that might require certain
knowledge that you might not otherwise have had. As a nice side-effect,
taking notes always helps me to recall the book later on, even if I
never look at the notes afterwards. The very act of taking notes seems
to help me to crystalize ideas.</p>
<h3 id="keep-a-reading-log">Keep a reading log</h3>
<p>Since I was a kid I’ve kept a list<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> of the books that I’ve
read and the dates that I started reading and the date that I completed
reading. This may seem a bit gratuitous, but there is a good reason for
doing this. That is, by <a
href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3514864.Michael_Fogus">keeping
a record</a> you’ll start to recognize patterns. For example, you might
notice that you happen to <a
href="https://twitter.com/#!/fogus/status/172316071787905027">dislike
certain sub-genres of sci-fi</a> and will learn to avoid them. There are
many patterns to find in your reading habits and the avoidance of genres
is just one.</p>
<p>And that’s it. Those are effectively my reading tricks. I have no
idea if these are generally applicable, but if you think so then I’m
happy to have helped.</p>
