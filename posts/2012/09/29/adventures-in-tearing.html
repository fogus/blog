<p>An interesting thought exercise is to pull apart ideas that are
typically thought inseparable. One could call this act <a
href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">decomplecting</a>,<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but for the purposes of this post
I’ll coin the term “adventures in tearing.”</p>
<p>A few interesting examples in the wild include:</p>
<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>
<p><a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html">The Kernel
programming language</a> pulls apart function creation into two parts:
1. <code>$vau</code> - an operator<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> like <code>lambda</code>
in Lisp-like languages but without evaluation if its arguments. 2.
<code>wrap</code> - an operator that takes the result<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> of
<code>$vau</code> and creates a function that receives its arguments
evaluated.</p>
<h2 id="david-hume">David Hume</h2>
<p>Whether you agree with <a
href="http://www.constitution.org/dh/hume.htm">David Hume’s
philosophy</a> or not, it’s difficult to deny that he was a master of
tearing ideas apart into their constituent parts. Often when examining a
composite’s parts you’ll gain a deeper understanding of the whole.
Instead, Hume famously attempted to use tearing to unravel the very
fabric of human understanding.</p>
<p>Specifically, one of Hume’s famous passages talks about the action of
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/9662/9662-h/9662-h.htm">one
billiard ball connecting with another</a>. The human notion that the
action of one ball hitting another <em>causes</em> the other to move,
according to Hume, is an illusion. Instead, causality is a fabrication
of the human mind assigned to antecedent and sequent events conjoined in
time. Further, that humans believe that any event causes another is a
bias built over a lifetime of observing events constantly conjoined in a
consistent way.</p>
<p>This is an exercise in tearing taken to an extreme that has motivated
philosophers since 1748.</p>
<h2 id="wat">Wat</h2>
<p>Manuel Simoni’s <a href="https://github.com/manuel/wat-js">Wat
programming language</a> decomposes type definition, creation, tags and
access from the typical type/class definition model.</p>
<p>An example of Wat used in this way is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(def (type-tag type-creator type-accessor) (make-type))
;;=&gt; (#{anonymous} #[Applicative anonymous] #[Applicative anonymous])</code></pre>
<p>Where the <code>make-type</code> function returns a triplet described
by the names above. The interesting part about this feature is that it
separates creation from access allowing one to limit access to one
aspect or both using ad hoc encapsulation mechanisms. This is very
similar to <a
href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/creatingmorestructs.html">Racket’s
<code>make-struct-type</code> feature</a> with and added element of
runtime reflection. It’s a very clever extension to Scheme that seems
fairly obvious in hindsight. That’s the funny thing about obviousness;
it’s of course obvious once someone shows it to you. Unfortunately,
people (and even programmers) are apt to take the obvious for granted
and fail to see things as anything less than wholly formed ideas. Wat’s
<code>make-type</code> feature has helped me to better grasp some
elusive aspects of types, privacy and reflection.</p>
<p>Mr. Simoni talks more about this particular <a
href="http://axisofeval.blogspot.com/2012/08/schemes-missing-ingredient.html">Wat
capability in a blog post</a>; I highly recommend reading it.</p>
<h2 id="clojure">Clojure</h2>
<p><a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> pulls apart transformation
from data representation and order in its <a
href="http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/08/reducers-a-library-and-model-for-collection-processing.html">reducers
library</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Clojure has a multimethods feature that splits the idea
of function dispatch from the dispatch logic itself. Instead, Clojure’s
multimethods allow you to define a function that is used as the dispatch
logic that itself can be a different multimethod.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fini">Fini</h2>
<p>There are other great examples of <em>adventures in tearing</em>
including, but not limited to: <a
href="http://www.datomic.com">Datomic</a>, <a
href="http://www.alu.org/mop/index.html">Common Lisp’s MOP</a>, the
stack in Forth-like languages, <code>shift</code>/<code>reset</code> in
delimited continuation models, and Mathematica’s <a
href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/CollectingExpressionsDuringEvaluation.html">Reap
and Sow</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about tearing ideas apart and while I’ve not
blazed new ground I think that I’ve gained a greater appreciation for
some (for me) difficult ideas. The process of tearing, or decomplecting
if you will, has given me greater insight into <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a>, <a
href="http://www.github.com/clojure/core.unify">unification</a>, and
continuations. Once you get the mindset it’s difficult to avoid viewing
the world, ideas, prejudices and software as conglomerates of finer
grained notions – or at least attempting to anyway. I hope that further
adventures in tearing can shed some light on my recent elusive problems
like browser-based apps, simulation, and event sourcing.</p>
<p>I plan to continue my studies in tearing and will <a
href="http://www.complected.org/">share</a> my ideas as I go. I hope
that you’ll share yours as well.</p>

the Decomplector General.[^st] His ability to pull apart a system into

<li id="fn3"><p>The combination of these two operations combine to
provide function semantics similar to common programming languages. That
is, <code>lambda</code> (or JavaScript-style <code>function</code>) is
<em>not</em> a primitive type, but instead composed of two other more
primitive features.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>While you can abuse multimethods along a dispatch chain
like this, it can be a bit confusing. Additionally, although Clojure’s
multimethods are open in regard to the dispatch value, the dispatch
function is locked by default. There are ways around that, but they’re
ill advised.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
