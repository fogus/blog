<p>Dan Weinreb didn’t know me, but I am very familiar and a great
admirer of his work. However, one day a few years ago I wrote a blog
post entitled “<a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2009/02/06/yegge-clojure-arc-and-lolita-or-days-of-future-past/">Yegge,
Clojure, Arc, and Lolita: or Days of Future Past</a> that generated some
very interesting discussion. Among the best pieces of information-dense
wisdom, and one that I’ve never forgotten, was posted by Mr. Weinreb
himself. Although he addresses points in my blog post and comments
attached to it, the comment stands mostly on its own, and in homage I
will quote it in full below:</p>
<blockquote>
I’m not sure what the “Common Lisp contains multitudes” phrase was
intended to mean. (Yes, I do recognize the reference to Whitman.)
Portability between Common Lisp implementations is excellent when it
comes to things that are actually covered by the standard, and there are
lots of useful libraries to provide portable ways to do things beyond
the scope of the languages (e.g. usocket, CFFI, many more). <br/><br/>
We have ported our 500KLOC airline reservation system core from SBCL to
Clozure CL (formerly OpenMCL). It took a bit of work because of some
fancy stuff we do, but it wasn’t very hard. We now maintain it in both
implementations; every night our buildbots compile and test the code in
both implementations, just for extra testing. No problem. <br/><br/>
(OK, not all of the 11 implementations are quite that good, but about 8
of them really are.) <br/><br/> Yes, there is plenty of interest in
Clojure in the Common Lisp community. At the International Lisp
Conference (ilc09.org) I intend to get a lot of discussion going about
the future of Lisp and how we can all try to move together (and less
like a herd of cats!) to pool our efforts. The ultimate success would be
to bring the Scheme world and the regular-Lisp world together on one
language, although I suspect that’s too hard to accomplish and the
Scheme people need to own their own language, so that they can
experiment with it, but, we’ll see. <br/><br/> Yes, mostly-functional
languages with software transactional memory is the big new trend. Many
new languages are being created based on this, and Rich was far-seeing
to do it in Clojure. Yes, it’s primarily because we’ll all be writing
more concurrent software to take advantage of all the cores. <br/><br/>
The Lisp s-expression structure is not exactly analogous to an AST in
the sense that the compiler community means. An AST is a deeper, richer
structure on which a lot of information is hung by the compiler,
usually. The s-expressions are more of a “surface syntax”, which is the
right place to put extensibility (macros) since ordinary language users
won’t understand an AST, and it’s not even clear that it’s a good idea
to make the AST’s data structures part of the externally-defined
language standard. <br/><br/> Macros of Lisp-like power for languages
with infix-style syntax have been explored. See Jonathan Bachrach’s Java
Syntactic Extender, and the Dylan language. Dave Moon will be presenting
a new paper on this at the Lisp conference.
</blockquote>
<p>Based on what I’ve heard, it seems he was always willing to share his
vast wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>Goodbye Mr. Weinreb. You will be missed by many; myself included.</p>
