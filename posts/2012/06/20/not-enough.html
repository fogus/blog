<p>Let’s start with a premise, indulge me if you please:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re creating a system for some client</li>
<li>You’re using a dynamic programming language like Clojure, Ruby, Io,
etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you know your system works properly? One answer is that you
write unit tests. However, as Evan Farrer wrote in his excellent blog
post, “<a
href="http://evanfarrer.blogspot.ca/2012/06/unit-testing-isnt-enough-you-need.html?m=1">Unit
testing isn’t enough. You need static typing too.”</a>. I think this
he’s absolutely correct; unit testing is not enough. But…</p>
<h2 id="static-typing-is-not-enough.-you-need-contracts-too.">Static
typing is not enough. You need contracts too.</h2>
<p>However, while static typing will catch a very large class of errors
that you may never discover with unit testing, they will not catch
everything. There are a certain class of errors that are caused by
subtle, broken relationships between inputs to any given function or
method and their results. This is where <a
href="http://www.github.com/fogus/trammel">contracts can really save
you</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2
id="contracts-are-not-enough.-you-need-generative-testing-too.">Contracts
are not enough. You need generative testing too.</h2>
<p>But how do you know that your contracts are valid? That is, how do
you know that you’ve identified them all? Likewise, how do you know that
the contracts that you’ve specified are consistent? One way of tackling
this problem is a class of verification where tests are either inferred
directly from the contract specifications, or you may need to use a
limits <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck">specification
language</a> to effectively restate the contracts. In either case the
intent is to target the assumptions of functions and methods with a mass
of data inputs.</p>
<h2
id="generative-testing-is-not-enough.-you-need-simulation-testing-too.">Generative
testing is not enough. You need simulation testing too.</h2>
<p>So you’ve written specifications (or had them inferred) that validate
that your local assumptions hold true. What about the behavior of the
system as a whole? It’s unlikely that generative testing will provide
help there. Instead, another approach may be to create a testing harness
to simulate parts of your system talking to other parts in different
aggregations up to the level of the user interacting with the system qua
system. The power in this approach comes ex post-facto. That is, I
assume you would collect system activity into some external store that
is then independently verified for accuracy.</p>
<h2
id="simulation-testing-is-not-enough.-you-need-fuzzing-too.">Simulation
testing is not enough. You need fuzzing too.</h2>
<p>I hope that you remembered to cover more than the happy path in your
simulation tests. If not, then you probably missed the opportunity to
check if your system works in the presence of massive chaos and
confusion (i.e. the real world). <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzzing</a> should help you
here.</p>
<h2 id="fuzzing-is-not-enough.-you-need-luck-too.">Fuzzing is not
enough. You need luck too.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. – Ben Kenobi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The odd thing about fuzzing is that it may not hit on the magical
incantation that breaks your system. <a
href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2001-10-25/">That’s the problem
with randomness; you can never be sure</a>.</p>
<h2 id="luck-is-not-enough.-you-need-user-testing-too.">Luck is not
enough. You need user testing too.</h2>
<p>What if you created the wrong system? You may have observed every
step in this post, but what you’ll have created is merely a verifiable
piece of garbage.</p>
<p>I hope the intent of my post is clear.</p>
<p><strong>In software development, no one thing will save your
ass.</strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This is daunting to say the least. In the face of all of this
complexity<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and uncertainty why on earth would
anyone willingly become a programmer?</p>
<p>The answer is simple.</p>
