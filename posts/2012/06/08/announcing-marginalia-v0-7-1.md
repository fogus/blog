Changes from v7.0.0
-------------------

### lein-marginalia

As always, the prefered way to use Marginalia to generate your documentation is via the [lein-marginalia](http://github.com/fogus/lein-marginalia) Leiningen plugin, like so:

    :dev-dependencies [[lein-marginalia "0.7.1"]]

To run Marginalia, simply run `lein marg <options> <files>` in your project's directory.

### Multidoc Generation

Marginalia has long supported the generation of documentation where each namespace is contained in its own HTML file. This feature is finally exposed via the command-line/Lein interface and executed as `lein marg --multi <more options> <files>`.

### Bug fixes

* As found in enabling `--multi`
* Minor stylistic changes in the generated documentation
* More information in the project README

Plans
-----

The following capabilities are under design, development, or consideration for future versions of Marginalia:

* Nicer looking `toc.html` generation in `--multi` mode output.
* protocol docstring support
* Stand-alone application
* Explore the possibility of leveraging the [ClojureScript](http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) analyzer.
* Explore the possibility of leveraging [sjacket](https://github.com/cgrand/sjacket)
* More documentation and examples

More planning is needed around capabilities not listed nor thought of.
