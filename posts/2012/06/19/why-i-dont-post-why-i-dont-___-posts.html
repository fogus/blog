<p>While surfing the vast and crapulent Internets I’ve seen many a blog
post kind, but one of the more insidious<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is
the “Why I Don’t ____”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> variety. Typically the premise of
such posts starts as why the blogger “don’t use some programming
language”, “don’t like cake” or “don’t not club baby seals” and follows
up with a laundry list of points – some of them perfectly valid.
However, the reason these types of posts are particularly yucky is that
they tend to be written in a way that implies that anecdotal evidence is
important. That’s not to say that anecdotes are valueless, only that
they are worth very little. For any given circumstance where I might do
anything, there are only a handful of relationships to said thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know nothing about it</li>
<li>I’ve investigated the options thoughtfully and have decided for or
against it</li>
<li>I’m an advocate for it</li>
<li>I already know that I hate it</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore the value of anecdote for each case is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know nothing about it</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Anecdote provides a data point for use in an eventual
investigation</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve investigated the options thoughtfully and have decided for or
against it</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The anecdote may illuminate some aspect I’ve not thought about or
it may not apply to me, in which case I’ll disagree</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m an advocate for it</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The anecdote may only serve as an irritant.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I already know that I hate it</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You’re preaching to the choir</em></p>
<p>In the two cases where the “Why I Don’t ___” post provides useful
data the value is either slight or rare to occur. However, the true
punch comes in the negative cases. The Internet is fueled on negativity,
but anecdotal negativity does not tend to supply useful information. I
understand how fun it is to make fun of programming languages and
frameworks, but for serious work involving their domains then due
diligence is absolutely required – professionalism demands it.</p>
<p>So why are you writing your “Why I Don’t ___” post? Do you hope to
provide valueable information, or are you simply trying to spout off? I
don’t very often find occasion to quote _why the Lucky Stiff, but in
this case it’s appropriate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes
rather than ability. your tastes only narrow &amp; exclude people. so
create.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Create indeed.</p>
