[^0]: I heard this term somewhere but I can't remember where. Any pointers would be helpful.

[^1]: This one can take two forms, the first is the non-dickery form and one of maximum dickery: 1) a rhetorical question that sets up a canned answer and 2) the start of an answer to a earnest question.

[^2]: [The Joy of Clojure](http://www.joyofclojure.com) uses this phrase twice. :-(

[^3]: Thanks to Steve Losh for the open source related PoMDs.
