<p>Learning a new programming language, library or framework can be
difficult. It often takes an incredible amount of patience, time and
persistence to properly learn something new and of even moderate
complexity. Given this unavoidable commitment, programmers are often
reticent to choose one option over another. Granted, programmers looking
to transition away from .NET as a career choice probably has all the
motivation they need to learn Java and the popular products of its
ecosystem. However, for the casual, autodidact or adventurous programmer
presented with a cyclopean mountain of choice, there is, on the surface,
little reason to choose one option over another. Therefore, like many
choices chosen by computerists, there is a strong desire to cut corners
in their learning, or at least receive as much help as possible along
the way.</p>
<p>One extremely simple way that a software designer or community can
help the neophyte is what I like to call the <em>Minimum Viable
Snippet</em>. The Minimum Viable Snippet is a tiny fragment of source
code that adheres to the following properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s located on the landing page of the main software site.</li>
<li>It is typically located in a way that draws the eye.</li>
<li>It is fervently representative of the library, language or
framework.</li>
<li>It’s short and sweet and as elegant as possible; either self-evident
in its intent or minimally explained via commentary.</li>
</ol>
<p>While you will not always find that the Minimum Viable Snippet is
given a place of central focus (point #2), the less scrolling required
to see it the better. An important point about #3 is that under no
circumstances should the Minimum Viable Snippet be a “Hello World”
example. You can do better, but it might require some thought. Take some
time to think up a snippet that illustrates what your software is all
about. Finally, #4 is important because it really highlights the
essential nature of your software or language. That is, if the Minimum
Viable Snippet is 500 lines long, then it gives the prospective user a
notion of what kind of pain they can expect. Likewise, if the snippet is
without commentary, then a programming language like <a
href="http://www.jsoftware.com/">J</a> is fighting an uphill battle.</p>
<p>There are some excellent examples of Minimum Viable Snippets to take
inspiration from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regardless of your feelings about <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, it’s MVS fits almost all of the
criteria listed above.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby’s Minimum Viable
Snippet</a> is positioned perfectly, is nicely commented, and is lovely.
Sadly it’s a “Hello World”, but at least it’s nicely motivated by the
commentary.</p></li>
<li><p>One of my favorites is the MVS on <a
href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">the Sinatra homepage</a>. It could
stand to be syntax highlighted, but otherwise it’s near
perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>The programming language <a
href="http://roy.brianmckenna.org/">Roy</a> has no MVS, but it has
something else entirely; an operational programming console on the page
itself. However, it would be nice to see some code prepopulating the
console, awaiting one to hit the enter key.</p></li>
<li><p>The contracts for Java library <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/cofoja/">Cofoja</a> has a nice MVS on its
landing page. As a bonus, it’s highly representational of the library
itself and the philosophy of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">DbC</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Other nice examples (not comprehensive) include: <a
href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a>, <a
href="http://jamesiry.github.com/jADT/index.html">jADT</a>, <a
href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda Time</a>, <a
href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a>. Comment below if you know
of more.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So should we choose our programming languages and frameworks based
solely on the MVS alone? Absolutely not, but it benefits the user to see
a carefully chosen example of use from the start in order to save them
some precious cycles trying to track one down. Likewise it benefits the
creator and community supporting the software to provide a low-pass
filter for those who are likely to dismiss a system or language over its
Minimum Viable Snippet. Everyone wins.</p>
<p>It’s one of the few things in software that is a no-brainer.</p>
