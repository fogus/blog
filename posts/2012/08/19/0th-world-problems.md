0th-world problems are like [first-world problems]() except only applicable to computerists. ([hashtag is #0th](https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%230th&src=hash)) Examples include, but are not limited to:

* Ending relationships due to a fundamental disagreement over whether [arrays should be 0, 1 or open indexed](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ZeroAndOneBasedIndexes).

* Losing sleep trying to solve the world's [Hacker News ranking algorithm problem](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4399108).

* Fear and loathing over a ruined Star Wars franchise.

* Agonizing over which PLT-related Twitter novelty account is the best.

* Decrying the world-wide shortage of essential Raspberry Pi.

* The existential crisis resulting from finding out that you were really a [conservative software developer](https://plus.google.com/u/0/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz) after all.

* A fundamental refusal to use software with a price tag.

* That feeling of inadequacy that comes from loving a programming language that you're unable to use as resume padding.

* That Guy Steele can no longer find a job because he spent the past 10-years working in [a language no one's ever heard of](https://blogs.oracle.com/projectfortress/entry/fortress_wrapping_up).

* An inability to locate an implement to use in scooping out the deeply recessed life-giving Yan Yan sauce (straddles the line between 0th and 1st world).

* That exquisite rage felt upon learning that someone's squatting a sweet domain name.

More?
