<p>Sigils are little symbols attached to a variable name that provide
some information regarding its type, scope, or simply marking it as
different from non-variables. There is very little middle-ground on the
opinion toward variable <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming)">sigils</a>
among programmers; you either love them, or you hate them. The
quintessential language containing sigils is probably Perl, followed by
BASIC, and more recently Ruby. I pick these three because they use
sigils for different purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>BASIC <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> sigils denote datatypes</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>foo$</code> denotes a variable holding a string</li>
<li><code>foo%</code> denotes an integer</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Perl sigils denote a datatype category <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>$foo</code> denotes a scalar type</li>
<li><code>@foo</code> denotes an array</li>
<li><code>%foo</code> denotes a hash</li>
<li><code>&amp;foo</code> denotes a subroutine</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Ruby sigils denote a variable’s scope <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>$foo</code> denotes a global variable</li>
<li><code>@foo</code> denotes an instance variable</li>
<li><code>@@foo</code> denotes a class variable</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally like sigils – very much so. However, I tend to prefer
the types of sigils used by Ruby rather than the finer-grained meaning
attached to Perl and BASIC sigils (which is also the reason that I
dislike <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian
notation</a>). I like being able to read my source and, at a glance,
soak in the maximum amount of information. Sigils, when used sparingly,
can provide a tremendous service. However, there is a fine line between
sigils providing useful information and those akin to <a
href="http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Ruby/LineNoise.rdoc">line-noise</a>.
My head tends to swim when looking at some <a
href="http://snippets.dzone.com/tag/perl">Perl code</a> due to the
presence of sigils, but maybe that’s just me (<a
href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/ancient-languages-perl">probably
not</a>). Therefore, when I set out to design <a
href="/2008/08/19/project-doris/">my own experimental language</a>,
effective sigils were high on my wish list.</p>
<h2 id="first-cut">First Cut</h2>
<p>Since my sandbox programming language <a
href="http://github.com/fogus/ix/tree/master">Ix</a> is based on the <a
href="http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/">CLIPS</a> source base, I
wholly adopted the CLIPS convention. That is, CLIPS denotes variables
using by pre-pending <code>?</code> or <code>$?</code> to the front of a
symbol. By convention, the former was meant to denote a scalar while the
latter was meant for multifield <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> variables, but they
could both be used interchangeably <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Therefore, a simple
reduce function initially looked like this:</p>
<pre lang="ix">
fn( reduce
  [?f $?lst]
  if(empty?($?lst)
    call(?f)
  else
    call(?f first($?lst)
            reduce(?f rest($?lst)))))

reduce(_(1 2 3 4 5) +)
</pre>
<p>Not too bad, but the sigils clutter up what is effectively a succinct
function. As an added disadvantage, I decided a long time ago that
predicate functions in Ix should have a question mark at the end of
them; therefore, in this small function the question mark has two
different meanings depending on the context. But even still, I stuck
with this syntax for months.</p>
<h2 id="second-cut">Second Cut</h2>
<p>After writing a pile of code in the first version of Ix, I decided to
add some syntactic sugar for the <code>(call)</code> function (see its
usage above). As a result, the code above became:</p>
<pre lang="ix">
fn( reduce
  [?f $?lst]
  if(empty?($?lst)
    ?f()
  else
    ?f(first($?lst)
       reduce(?f rest($?lst)))))

reduce(_(1 2 3 4 5) +)
</pre>
<p>This looked a little better than the original, but there were a
couple of issues that stuck with me:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <code>$?</code> sigil was still too noisey</li>
<li>The <code>?f()</code> form is hideous, and <code>$?f()</code> even
moreso</li>
<li>The issue of differing meanings for <code>?</code> still
remained</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="third-cut">Third Cut</h2>
<p>I initially decided to live with issues #2 and #3 and instead remove
the $? form altogether.</p>
<pre lang="ix">
fn( reduce
  [?f ?lst]
  if(empty?(?lst)
    ?f()
  else
    ?f(first(?lst)
       reduce(?f rest(?lst)))))

reduce(_(1 2 3 4 5) +)
</pre>
<p>Better? It took me a while to learn to hate this new syntax, but
eventually I did. While reducing the <code>$?</code> noise, it
introduced a whole new problem. That is, when calling predicate
functions, the pattern <code>?(?</code> tended to cause mass confusion
(at least for me). My mind would often fill in the second question mark
even in its absence thus turning something like <code>symbol?(x)</code>
into <code>symbol?(?x)</code>. Why is this a problem instead of and
outright syntax error? The answer is that symbols in Ix are defined as
any sequence of characters not starting with a number, and not
containing a small set of delimiters. <a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Therefore, in the first call <code>x</code> is a symbol and thus the
call to <code>symbol?()</code> always evaluates to true. It took me only
a few frustrating debugging sessions to see the err of my ways.</p>
<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>After much despairing over the seeming disparity between wishing to
keep sigils and requiring the presence of symbols as defined above, I
hit on a very nice compromise. That is, who’s to say that a sigil
<strong>must</strong> be a non-alphabetical character (or sequence
thereof)?</p>
<pre lang="ix">
fn( reduce
  [F Lst]
  if(empty?(Lst)
    F()
  else
    F(first(Lst)
      reduce(F rest(Lst)))))

reduce(_(1 2 3 4 5) +)
</pre>
<p>So what happened? Simple. Variables are now identified as starting
with a capital letter. Assuredly, this is nothing new in the history of
programming language design, but it did solve nicely the issues
above:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Less visible noise</li>
<li>Variables and symbols are clearly delineated</li>
<li>F() looks much nicer</li>
<li>There is now only one meaning of <code>?</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, the <code>symbol(x)</code> issue now evolved into
<code>symbol(X)</code> issue, I found that the occurrences of this
mistake disappeared once the confusing <code>?(?</code> pattern
disappeared likewise. I think I’ve hit on the right formula for sigils
in Ix. That is, I’ve reduced the granularity of their meaning to be
agnostic of type and scope, while at the same time clearly separating
symbols from variables.</p>
<p>Sigils are nice; <a
