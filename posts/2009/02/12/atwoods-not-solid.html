<p>Jeff Atwood, the patron saint of <a
href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2009/01/cost-of-net-negative-producing.html">NNPPs</a>,
recently wrote a post <a
href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001225.html">decrying
SOLID as Ferengi programming</a>. Stepping back, <a
href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID</a>
is a set of principles outlined by <a
href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/category/uncle-bobs-blatherings">Robert
Martin</a> that distill his 200 years of Object-oriented programming
into a set of best practices fostering agility, testability,
extensibility, and any other <em>ity</em> that you can think of.
Mr. Atwood warns us that the SOLID principles are created by someone who
likely has not written a lot of code, and are not feasible for
programmers who write software in the <em>real world</em>.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, a common theme that I see in the comment section is
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I created tons of software w/o SOLID and the customer was happy, so
that’s all that matters in the real world. <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statement above would be laughable, if it weren’t almost true.
That is, software development is an interesting field in that there is a
very large spectrum of competence. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It’s almost like a
baseball talent pyramidal structure where for every all-star developer
at the top, there are two for each of them in skill, and four below for
each of them, etc… <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Sadly, at any competency level
software can be developed that <em>gets the job done and makes the
customer happy</em>. In all but the most blatent of cases, it is very
difficult for the customer, who is often not versed in software
development, to tell the difference in quality between software written
by all-stars and those by no-stars. So if that were the case, who cares
right?</p>
<p>The problem really manifests for the developers downstream tasked
with maintenance; you know, <a
href="https://www.thedacs.com/databases/url/key/5881">the majority</a>.
I think Mr. Atwood is completely dismissive of these developers by
preaching such a laissez-faire approach. But honestly, there is often
very little that is sexy about the maintenance cycle, and he certainly
wouldn’t have such a following if he chose it as the focus of his blog.
However, not all projects are blessed with developers at the caliber of
Mr. Atwood’s ninja programming team. Instead, most teams are populated
all along the competency spectrum (and many filled primarily from the
base) and it’s these <em>real world</em> teams that absolutely must
adhere to a solid set of software development principles in order to
maintain some semblance of sanity in the codebase.</p>
<p>Regardless <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/noop.html">how you feel
about Object-oriented programming</a>, it is difficult for me to
understand why one would choose to disparage the SOLID principles; that
is, unless you’ve already internalized the majority of them over the
years without realizing it, or you revel in your NNPP status.</p>
