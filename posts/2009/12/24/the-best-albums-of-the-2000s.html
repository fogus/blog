<h2 id="boards-of-canada---geogaddi-2002">Boards of Canada - Geogaddi
(2002)</h2>
<p>My friend <a href="http://blog.founddrama.net">Rob</a> introduced
this album to me about 6 years ago and it has since been in constant
rotation. In many ways, it’s this album that foreshadows the entire <a
href="http://www.flakmag.com/features/hauntology.html">Hauntology</a>
movement. Every track is a shining star.</p>
<h2 id="untrue---burial-2007">Untrue - Burial (2007)</h2>
<p>As Warren Ellis put it, <a
href="http://twitter.com/warrenellis/status/5742856627">“Dubstep’s on
the verge of its Elton John phase”</a>. This might be true, but
<em>Untrue</em> is a shining example of everything that is right with
Dubstep. Awesome album from start to finish.</p>
<h2 id="gas---pop-2000">Gas - Pop (2000)</h2>
<p>There is nothing better for getting into a programming headspace than
Wolfgang Voight’s Gas project <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018LMKGW/?tag=fogus-20">Nah Und
Fern</a>. The final installment, released in 2000 is not necessarily my
favorite of the lot, but it’s a nice stand-in for the entire set.</p>
<h2 id="björk---vespertine-2001">Björk - Vespertine (2001)</h2>
<p>I love everything that Björk has ever produced, but <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G75AOS/?tag=fogus-20">Vespertine</a>
stands at the top of her output for me.</p>
<h2 id="tool---lateralus-2001">Tool - Lateralus (2001)</h2>
<p>Likewise with Björk, I’ve never met a Tool album that I didn’t love.
<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005B36H/?tag=fogus-20">Lateralus</a>
is a nice transitional album from their harder edge earlier work to the
headier, more recent output.</p>
<h2 id="sigur-rós---ágætis-byrjun-2000">Sigur Rós - Ágætis Byrjun
(2000)</h2>
<p>I first heard <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005IC2H/?tag=fogus-20">Ágætis
Byrjun</a> based on a recommendation from the old <a
href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/nav/start.asp?webtag=ellis">Warren
Ellis Forum</a> (WEF) and was instantly blown away. I had never heard
anything like it before, or since. Sigur Rós has become a fairly
well-known band since, but at the time it was pretty edgy stuff.</p>
<h2 id="radiohead---amnesiac-2001">Radiohead - Amnesiac (2001)</h2>
<p>Most lists have either <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPF130/?tag=fogus-20">OK
Computer</a> or <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BVXYRM/?tag=fogus-20">Kid
A</a> as the best Radiohead album of the 2000s, but for me <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BVXYRC/?tag=fogus-20">Amnesiac</a>
is much better for writing code to – putting it over the top. Radiohead,
like Tool, produces an staggering number of <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2004/08/24/perfect-albums">perfect
albums</a>.</p>
<h2 id="belbury-poly---the-owls-map-2008">Belbury Poly - The Owl’s Map
(2008)</h2>
<p>I have only recently found <a href="http://www.ghostbox.co.uk/">Ghost
Box Records</a> and likewise <a
href="http://www.ghostbox.co.uk/theowlsmap.htm">The Owl’s Map</a>. Ghost
Box is changing the face of music, and this album is indicative of the
future, and past, of what we will be hearing for some time.</p>
<h2 id="susumu-yokota---symbol-2005">Susumu Yokota - Symbol (2005)</h2>
<p>I really like Susumu Yokota, but the guy’s unbelievably prolific and
hard to keep up with. However, at the top of his mountain of releases is
<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008G2FIG/?tag=fogus-20">Symbol</a>.</p>
<h2 id="burial---burial-2006">Burial - Burial (2006)</h2>
<p>The only musician to make the list twice is Burial with his <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA55X2/?tag=fogus-20">debut
album</a> which was my first exposure to dubstep.</p>
<h2 id="sunn-o---monoliths-dimensions-2009">Sunn O))) - Monoliths &amp;
Dimensions (2009)</h2>
<p>Sunn O))) (pronounced Sun) is transforming heavy metal (maybe they
already have) music. Most of their work is pretty intense, but their
latest, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UJSVTC/?tag=fogus-20">Monoliths
and Dimensions</a> is approachable even if you’re not into heavy metal
per se. Forget what you think you know about metal – Sunn O))) turns
that all inside out. As an added bonus, the song Aghartha makes a nice
companion to Rich Hickey’s talk on <a
href="http://blip.tv/file/812787">Concurrency</a>. I discovered this by
accident.</p>
<h2 id="the-white-stripes---elephant-2003">The White Stripes - Elephant
(2003)</h2>
<p>I love <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AP11L6/?tag=fogus-20">Elephant</a>,
but for some strange reason I’ve never been compelled to track down
anything else by the White Stripes. Still, this is a great album.</p>
<h2 id="gnarls-barkley---the-odd-couple-2008">Gnarls Barkley - The Odd
Couple (2008)</h2>
<p>I originally thought that Gnarls Barkley was a joke band along the
lines of Flight of the Conchords and Tenacious D, so I avoided them like
the plague. However, I came across one of their songs from <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013H8QEG/?tag=fogus-20">The Odd
Couple</a> on <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/fojure">Last.fm</a> and
loved it. The entire album turned out to be great and it’s been on
regular rotation since.</p>
<h2 id="panda-bear---person-pitch-2007">Panda Bear - Person Pitch
(2007)</h2>
<p><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA27TE/?tag=fogus-20">Person
Pitch</a> Sounds like late 1950s Italian-American Doo-wop, with an
electronic background, played on a broken phonograph in a giant empty
Army barracks heard through a cup pressed against the outside wall – yet
still works for me.</p>
<h2 id="saves-the-day---stay-what-you-are-2001">Saves the Day - Stay
What You Are (2001)</h2>
<p>In a time when pop-punk all but died an agonizing death, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005M977/?tag=fogus-20">Stay
What You Are</a> manages to capture the spirit of this tired genre and
make it fresh again.</p>
<h2 id="isis---panopticon-2004">Isis - Panopticon (2004)</h2>
<p>Isis is the <em>other</em> heavy metal band changing the genre.
Although all of their albums from the 2000s are excellent, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Z83KC/?tag=fogus-20">Panopticon</a>
stands out as the richest musical experience.</p>
<h2 id="magma---kohntarkosz-anteria-2004">Magma - Kohntarkosz Anteria
(2004)</h2>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn’t include one of the latest releases from
my favorite band Magma. Magma is one of those bands that you either love
or hate way down in your viscera the first time you hear them, although
their music seems to be making a resurgence. As far as I’m aware, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HOA3TG/?tag=fogus-20">Kohntarkosz
Anteria</a> is new material, but highly representative of that unique
Magma style.</p>
<h2 id="the-caretaker---theoretically-pure-anterograde-amnesia-2005">The
Caretaker - Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia (2005)</h2>
<p>It’s tough to categorize <a
href="http://brainwashed.com/vvm/micro/caretaker/vvmtcd25.htm">Theoretically
Pure Anterograde Amnesia</a> as music (like <em>Nah Und Fern</em>
mentioned earlier). The Caretaker builds complete sonic environments
with his music and at 72 tracks, this album is a day’s worth of sound
barrage. At the link above you can download the entire work, but if you
like it please consider buying the CD release.</p>
<h2 id="ruins---tzomborgha-2002">Ruins - Tzomborgha (2002)</h2>
<p>Ruins was (is?) an interesting band. They took the Zeuhl model
created by Magma and turned it up to 11 with <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000787GX/?tag=fogus-20">Tzomborgha</a>.
This is widely considered their best album, and I agree.</p>
<h2 id="kanye-west---the-college-drop-out-2004">Kanye West - The College
Drop Out (2004)</h2>
<p>It’s difficult for me to know the difference between Rap and R&amp;B
as my tastes in both are hopelessly stunted. However, whatever genre
this album is, it’s the best of “it” that I’ve ever heard. Kanye West is
such a characture these days that’s it’s tough to remember that he burst
onto the scene in a big way with an outstanding album in <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AP12G/?tag=fogus-20">The
College Drop Out</a>.</p>
<h2
id="montauk---the-moment-lasts-a-second-but-the-memory-lives-on-forever-2009">Montauk
- The Moment Lasts A Second, But The Memory Lives On Forever (2009)</h2>
<p>A great album from a little known artist (who has just recently
started his own label, <a
href="http://www.deafraven.com">deafraven</a>). <a
href="http://www.comatosefilms.com/DeafRaven/releases.html">TMLaS,btMLOF</a>
is the kind of music that you can listen to with the lights off,
headphones in, laying on your back – haunting and beautiful.</p>
<h2 id="linkin-park---meteora-2002">Linkin Park - Meteora (2002)</h2>
<p>I was very skeptical about [Meteora</p>
