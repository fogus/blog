<h1 id="my-programming-languages-history">My programming languages
history</h1>
<p>I find it fascinating to read personal programming histories and seek
them out whenever possible (still waiting for one from <a
href="http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/">Grant Rettke</a>, <a
href="http://olabini.com/">Ola Bini</a>, <a
href="http://clojure.org">Rich Hickey</a>, <a
href="http://danweinreb.org/blog/">Dan Weinreb</a>, and <a
href="http://www.drmaciver.com/">D.R. MacIver</a>). In case anyone is
interested, my own programming story is below.</p>
<h2 id="commodore-64-basic">1983 - 1990: Commodore 64 BASIC</h2>
<p>Made RPG and baseball utilities and games. I would also spend all
night typing in the game listings in the C64 magazines.</p>
<h2 id="kyan-pascal">1986: Kyan Pascal</h2>
<p>I think that it was Kyan Pascal for the C64, but I am a bit foggy on
the details. My mother’s co-worker gave me a copy.</p>
<h2 id="assembly">1987: 6510 Assembly</h2>
<p>My first and only attempt at cracking software.</p>
<h2 id="gw-basic-and-quickbasic">1988: GW-BASIC and QuickBASIC</h2>
<p>My beloved C64 was replaced by a DOS machine. I didn’t really like
it, but it was fun to hack around with RBBS.</p>
<h2 id="hex">1988-1990: Hex</h2>
<p>I would type those hexadecimal listings located in PC magazines and
run them through <code>DEBUG</code> to get little nifty utils. Tweaking
them here and there was an interesting way to figure out what the heck
was going on.</p>
<h2 id="turbo-pascal">1991-1993: Turbo Pascal</h2>
<p>For school projects and messing around with WildCat BBS.</p>
<h2 id="the-lost-year">1994: The Lost Year</h2>
<p><strong>I didn’t do much programming between highschool graduation
and college although when my DOS machine broke I had to dig out my old
C64 to write my college application essays.</strong></p>
<h2 id="lisp-and-c">1995-1999: Lisp and C</h2>
<p>My languages in undergrad which I used throughout, including some
T.A.ing.</p>
<h2 id="ada95">1998: Ada95</h2>
<p>Did some projects to attempt at getting some extra summer work, but
it didn’t pan out. Instead…</p>
<h2 id="assembly-1">1998: 1802 Assembly</h2>
<p>Got a summer job porting some Cosmac (a great freaking CPU) to…</p>
<h2 id="c">1998-1999: C</h2>
<p>Helped write the operating system for a realtime data acquisition
system as a summer job which eventually turned into a part-time gig
during my last year of undergrad.</p>
<h2 id="clips">1999-2000: CLIPS</h2>
<p>My first employer out of undergrad plopped a pile of spreadsheets in
front of me and said, “Here, make an expert system out of this”.</p>
<h2 id="c-1">1999-2002: C++</h2>
<p>Some computer vision stuff and some non-enthralling Windows
development.</p>
<h2 id="lisp-and-prolog">2001-2005: Lisp and Prolog</h2>
<p>As a student in an AI graduate program, these languages were my
primary tools.</p>
<h2 id="today-java">2002-today: Java</h2>
<p>The longest stretch with any language – some personal, but mostly
professional.</p>
<h2 id="jess">2004-2005: Jess</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, you have CLIPS experience? We need someone to do some Jess
work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="today-python">2007-today: Python</h2>
<p>Company internal utilities and applications as well as some of my own
personal stuff.</p>
<h2 id="today-scala">2008-today: Scala</h2>
<p>Web API stuff at work, Scala XML-framework stuff on my free time.</p>
<h2 id="today-clojure">2008-today: Clojure</h2>
<p><strong>All</strong> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of my personal development is done
with Clojure these days. It’s safe to say that it is my favorite so
far.</p>
<p>There are of course many other languages thrown in here and there,
but nothing of consequence.</p>
