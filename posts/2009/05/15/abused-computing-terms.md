After reading [David MacIver's recent post on the term functional](http://www.drmaciver.com/2009/05/a-problem-of-language/) I thought it would be interesting to compile a list of computing terms and ideas that are often abused:

-  Functional
-  DSL
-  Combinator
-  Closure
-  Monad (on the rise)
-  Lisp has no syntax
-  Immutability (more so in practice)
-  "... Considered Harmful"
-  Hacker
-  Enterprise
-  The Cloud
-  AJAX
-  REST
-  MVC (more so in practice)
-  HTML programming
-  SOA
-  Web 2.0
- Real-world

More to come...
