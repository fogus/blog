<p><em>this is another entry in a series on <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/tag/enrichment">programmer
enrichment</a></em></p>
<p>Most programmers looking to improve their craft are enthusiastic
about learning new programming languages. I am a huge proponent of
polyglot programming practices and as a result I attack literature, code
samples, and discussions regarding interesting programming languages and
dialects with a gusto unmatched by any other hobby in my life (save for
MST3K). I would like to take a moment to clarify my previous sentence.
That is, it’s not fair to qualify any particular programming language
with the term <em>interesting</em> because in fact</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all programming languages are interesting in <em>some</em> way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being said, I have accumulated a set of pet projects that I tend
to cycle through when learning new languages. Each pet project scratches
a certain itch and each requires differing approaches for solving. When
learning a new language I like to solve two or more of these pet
projects in order to get a feel for the capabilities and shortcomings of
said language. The current set of projects is as follows.</p>
<h2 id="lisp-interpreter">Lisp Interpreter</h2>
<p>The idea of creating an interpreter for a subset of Lisp has only
recently become <a href="http://github.com/fogus/lithp/tree">a
member</a> of my pet projects. I previously shied away from creating a
Lisp because it has become incredibly ubiquitous and it seemed silly to
throw Y.A.L.I. (<strong>Y</strong>et <strong>A</strong>nother
<strong>L</strong>isp <strong>I</strong>nterpreter) into the already
over-crowded landscape. However, upon further reflection on the matter I
realized</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the best way to learn two programming languages concurrently is to
write an interpreter or compiler of one using the other. However, it’s
highly probable that you will gain a deeper understanding of the
implemented language rather than the implementation language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not accurate to label this particular pet project a Lisp
interpreter because in all likelihood I will instead write one for a
wholly different language in order to more effectively reap the 2-1
benefits in the future.</p>
<h2 id="lexer-generator">Lexer Generator</h2>
<p>With outstanding tools like <a
href="https://javacc.dev.java.net">JavaCC</a>, <a
href="http://dinosaur.compilertools.net">Lex</a>, <a
href="http://www.antlr.org">Antlr</a>, and <a
href="http://flex.sourceforge.net">Flex</a> it seems unlikely that one
could further the current understanding of scanner generator techniques.
However, it’s useful to note</p>
<blockquote>
<p>your own set of pet projects should not attempt to be groundbreaking
but instead work to further your own understanding of their constituent
parts and how they are implemented using your chosen target language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you manage to do something truly innovative, then kudos to you.
However, I like to maintain a set of projects solving well-known
problems; that way the bulk of the implementation activity is spent
trying to solve the problem using the target language idioms and not in
research and design.</p>
<h2 id="knuths-pac-land">Knuth’s Pac-Land</h2>
<p>Pac-Land is essentially Conway’s Game of Life on steroids. It’s a
great project for targeting languages facilitating highly concurrent
programs.</p>
<h2 id="linear-algebra-library">Linear Algebra Library</h2>
<p>I do this mainly to refresh my mathematical muscles every couple of
years. This brings us to another principle one should adhere to with a
set of pet projects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not always exclusively about honing your programming skills. In
the world of pet projects, side-effects are a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="workflow-engine">Workflow Engine</h2>
<p>This project is mainly an attempt to finally get it right… next
time.</p>
<h2 id="m-ary-tree">m-ary Tree</h2>
<p>It’s a good idea to incorporate a data structures project into your
set. An <a
href="http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus5/html/page257.html">m-ary
tree</a> is as good as any and oft times better given that you can do
additional experimentation on the effects of: 1. Differing values for m
2. Immutability 3. Generic implementation</p>
<p>And to boot, it’s always fun to implement the searching and sorting
functions for the tree.</p>
<h2 id="now-do-this">Now Do This</h2>
<p>The most useful tool that I’ve come across in the past 3 years is
Jakob Lodwick’s <a href="http://nowdothis.com">Now Do This</a> TODO
application. It’s so simple in its perfection it almost hurts me
physically that I didn’t think of it first. In any case, it’s a great
little app that helps to exercise UI capabilities of a target
programming language.</p>
<h2 id="project-scaffolding-generator">Project Scaffolding
Generator</h2>
<p>This is a bit more involved and to be honest I haven’t done it in a
while since I last implemented it to learn Python, but it’s a good (and
practical) project. And that leads us to another principle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t worry about practicality when choosing your own pet projects,
but with all other things being equal favor it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="gap-buffer">Gap Buffer</h2>
<p>Long ago I set out to create <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2008/07/23/confessions-of-a-textual-loser/">my
own text editor</a>. However, after spending many hours on the task I
realized that it was unlikely that my editor would be any better than
hundreds of other editors. Therefore, I decided to call it quits after
finally getting to the point of having a usable (albeit lame) text
editor. That is not to say that my effort was wasted as I learned a lot,
which is the foremost <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> point of any pet programming
project. The most intriguing part was of course the runtime text storage
mechanism implemented as a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">gap buffer</a>. I will
occasionally feel nostalgic for my old gap buffer (I called it Gappy)
and have previously reimplemented it a couple of times, although it’s
been a while.</p>
<h1 id="next-generation-projects">Next generation projects</h1>
<p>Pet projects have come and gone and those listed above are no
different. That being the case, I have considered adding a couple
additional projects as listed below.</p>
<h2 id="twitter-client">Twitter client</h2>
<p>Creating a Twitter client has crossed my mind, but in all likelihood
by the time I feel motivated to do one there will be millions of others
available for study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not required to always write code. Instead, try supplementing
the creation of pet projects with the study of existing implementations
of your pet projects in your target language(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="project-euler">Project Euler</h2>
<p>I like the idea of <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project
Euler</a> but I simply cannot personally find any enthusiasm for
attempting the problems, which of course brings one additional principle
that you absolutely <strong>must</strong> adhere to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can forget every other principle – as long as you have fun</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your pet projects?</p>
