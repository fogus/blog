<p><em>This post was featured on the <a
href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> website. It is advised to <a
href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1403">jump there first</a> and then
sneak back here … eventually.</em></p>
<p>A couple weeks back I came across a post on creating the <a
href="http://www.nabble.com/-scala--ease-of-making-DSLs-in-Scala---nobody-cares-to22450638.html#a22450638">simplest
possible BASIC DSL written in Scala</a> by Szymon Jachim. The
implementation itself was dead simple to understand, but I suspected it
was due to the fact that it only provided <code>GOTO</code> and
<code>PRINT</code>. The title of the post was <em>ease of making DSLs in
Scala - nobody cares</em>, which was unfortunate because I think that
many people care, including myself, so I took it upon myself to extend
the DSL to be a pseudo-implementation of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC_programming_language">Tiny
BASIC</a>. In a nutshell, I found that it was simple to create an
internal DSL providing a simple dialect of BASIC using Scala. There were
some sticking points, which I will touch on later, but overall it was a
joy. The <a href="http://github.com/fogus/baysick/tree/master">code is
available</a> for public consumption, so feel free to try it, criticize
it, and/or improve it. I find it retains its simplicity even after
extending the original to provide additional forms and functions.</p>
<p>Here is a simple <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(computer_game)#Lunar_Lander_.281971.29">Lunar
Lander</a> game written in Baysick.</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=“bas” gist=“122994”] object Lunar extends Baysick {
def main(args:Array[String]) = { 10 PRINT “Welcome to Baysick Lunar
Lander v0.9” 20 LET (’dist := 100) 30 LET (’v := 1) 40 LET (’fuel :=
1000) 50 LET (’mass := 1000)</p>
<pre><code>60 PRINT &quot;You are drifting towards the moon.&quot;
70 PRINT &quot;You must decide how much fuel to burn.&quot;
80 PRINT &quot;To accelerate enter a positive number&quot;
90 PRINT &quot;To decelerate a negative&quot;

100 PRINT &quot;Distance &quot; % &#39;dist % &quot;km, &quot; % &quot;Velocity &quot; % &#39;v % &quot;km/s, &quot; % &quot;Fuel &quot; % &#39;fuel
110 INPUT &#39;burn
120 IF ABS(&#39;burn) &lt;= &#39;fuel THEN 150
130 PRINT &quot;You don&#39;t have that much fuel&quot;
140 GOTO 100
150 LET (&#39;v := &#39;v + &#39;burn * 10 / (&#39;fuel + &#39;mass))
160 LET (&#39;fuel := &#39;fuel - ABS(&#39;burn))
170 LET (&#39;dist := &#39;dist - &#39;v)
180 IF &#39;dist &gt; 0 THEN 100
190 PRINT &quot;You have hit the surface&quot;
200 IF &#39;v &lt; 3 THEN 240
210 PRINT &quot;Hit surface too fast (&quot; % &#39;v % &quot;)km/s&quot;
220 PRINT &quot;You Crashed!&quot;
230 GOTO 250
240 PRINT &quot;Well done&quot;

250 END

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Variables are denoted with the single quote which corresponds to
Scala’s symbol literals</li>
<li>The assignment operator is the Pascal-like <code>:=</code></li>
<li>The append operator for the <code>PRINT</code> form is
<code>%</code></li>
<li>Only integer math is supported</li>
<li>Strings cannot (currently) be compared using the relational
operators</li>
<li>Usage of Scala code within the BASIC forms is not fully
supported</li>
<li>There are currently only 6 math functions: <code>ABS</code>
<code>SQRT</code> <code>+</code> <code>-</code> <code>*</code> and
<code>/</code></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="issues">Issues</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>As has been mentioned by innumerable programmers advocating (and
deriding) DSLs, you are often constrained by the host language in the
grammar, error reporting, and hosting capabilities of your DSL. While
Scala allows you to support bizarre grammars without significantly
increasing the complexity, it does not necessarily facilitate a simple
way to provide solid error reporting and hosting. This is not
necessarily a limitation of Scala per se, but instead for general
purpose languages. In order to effectively build a wide range of DSLs
divorced from their underlying host we need a language that is
especially geared toward building DSLs. The two important language
features that Scala provides that makes it especially conducive for DSLs
are <a
href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=251945">operator
notation</a> and <a
href="http://lalitpant.blogspot.com/2008/08/scala-implicits-dose-of-magic-part-1.html">implicits</a>.
Usually, a language is considered DSL-friendly if it allows you to omit
the dot on a method call, but a really powerful DSL metalanguage would
have to go much much further than that.</p></li>
<li><p>For some strange reason I could not coax Scala into allowing my
<code>LET</code> forms to be parenthesis free. I assume that it is an
error on my part, but I was never able to solve it before my artificial
deadline expired.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="todo">Todo</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>A subroutine facility via <code>GOSUB</code> and
<code>RETURN</code></li>
<li>Allow strings to be compared using the relation operators</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it – Baysick: A Scala DSL Implementing BASIC.</p>
