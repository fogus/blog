<p>On January 20, 2014 the world lost a hacker named Timothy Hart. Hart
was not just any hacker – he was a hacker of the highest order. If
you’ve read more than three books on Lisp then you might have seen his
name pop up here and there. If not, then you’ve definitely felt his
influence.</p>
<h2 id="macros">Macros</h2>
<p>Macros are a ubiquitous element for any Lisp language in use today,
but the fact is that they were not part of the early LISP
implementations. Instead, LISP macros were invented years after
Russell’s first implementation by Hart and were described in a <a
href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6111">short MIT memo entitled
<em>MACRO Definitions for LISP</em></a>. This short but epic document
described an extension to the original seven-function LISP eval that
looked effectively like the following:</p>
<pre><code>((eq (caar expr) (quote macro))
 (cond
   ((eq (cadar expr) (quote lambda))
    (eval (eval (car (cdddar expr))
                (cons (list (car (caddar expr)) 
                            (cadr expr)) 
                      binds))
          binds))))</code></pre>
<p>After reading this paper I took some time to extend my tiny Lisp
interpreter Lithp to support Hart-style macros. Please take a moment to
read the original paper; you won’t be disappointed. It’s striking how a
feature so powerful and eventually far-reaching was described via a
humble, 3-page memo.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="alpha-beta-search">Alpha-Beta Search</h2>
<p>Sticking with short, yet deeply influential memos, Hart and D.J.
Edwards described a modification to the known <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax algorithm</a> that
would change game search forever. The paper, <em><a
href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6098">The Alpha-Beta
Heuristic</a></em> is 5-pages of astonishment and still stands as one of
the best descriptions of the technique. An interesting fact about
Alpha-Beta pruning is that it was independently invented by numerous
people and organizations. So go great ideas.</p>
<h2 id="lisp-1.5">LISP 1.5</h2>
<p>While a comprehensive write-up of Hart’s work would lead to a much
longer post, I wanted to highlight three that personally influenced me
in my programming life. While both the macro and alpha-beta papers were
important to me, neither more deeply influenced my thinking more than
the <a
href="http://www.mcjones.org/dustydecks/archives/2012/08/29/590/">LISP
1.5 Programmers Manual</a>. Hart is listed as one of the co-authors of
this amazing work and while I’m not certain of his precise contributions
to the manual, his association with the book and his contributions to
this early LISP implementation put him amongst the most influential Lisp
hackers in the history of the young computing industry. The <em>LISP 1.5
Programmer’s Manual</em> is near the top of any list of book that every
programmer should read.</p>
<p>Timothy Hart. Thank you and rest in peace.</p>
