In approximately 20 minutes I begin my first day at [Cognitect](http://cognitect.com/) as a &lt;there are no titles&gt;.  These are exciting times for me because it means[^1] that I can contribute more directly with the evolution of [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org), [ClojureScript](http://www.clojurescript.net), [Pedestal](http://pedestal.io/) and [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com). For the past year and a half I have used these tools (not so Pedestal) to great effect and am more excited about them than at any point in my history.  In addition, to helping with these fine tools, I hope to contribute to the human factors of Clojure and its ecosystem, including, but not limited to [documentation](http://www.clojure.com) and [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/).

My contributions along all of these vectors stand to be humble.  There are currently brilliant people working these angles, so my goal is to help without getting in the way.  Let's just say that I hope to be the Aquaman to Cognitect's Justice League.

Good times.

:F
