<p>I’ve been scaling back on blogging this past year and have tried
something different instead - <a

said, there were a couple of high-traffic posts on my blog.</p>

Technical Papers Every Programmer Should Read (At Least Twice)</a> –
<em>My most popular post of 2011 was also my most popular of 2012 and
also of 2013 and also of 2014 – go figure.</em></p></li>

<li><p><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1435455061/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fogus-20">Creating
Interactive Fiction with Inform7</a> – <em>Inform7 is a
perspective-altering programming language. It’s nearly the pinnacle of
languages that are informed (hah) by the types of problems that they’re
attempting to solve. Beautiful.</em></p></li>
<li><p><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0125635702/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fogus-20">Object
Oriented Forth</a> – <em>Honestly, I can’t think of better tech
literature available than those written about Forth.</em></p></li>

Under a Microscope</a> – <em>I’ll honestly say that I went into this
book expecting the worst. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I was
done that the book is a fairly nice dive into the Ruby internals. I’m
frankly shocked that a book like this was even published, but once again
the long tail reigns supreme; much to our benefit.</em></p></li>

avec Scheme</a> – <em>I read this in a marathon 3-days during Strange
Loop 2014 thanks to <a href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/cv/">Nada
Amin</a>, who hauled it all the way across the planet for me to read.
I’d really love to get another chance to go through it and digest it,
but I did like it very much on my first pass. My favorite part was that
while the prose was French, the code too was “very French”
also!</em></p></li>

by James Joyce – <em>I finally got around to reading this and wow am I
glad that I did. It took me a month to read and tended to dominate my
other parallel books at the time, but it was worth the effort. Leopold
Bloom is now one of my favorite anti-heroes from fiction.</em></p></li>

been an admirer of Jodorowsky’s films and graphic novels, so when I saw

book is filled with spoilers, so beware.</em></p></li>
