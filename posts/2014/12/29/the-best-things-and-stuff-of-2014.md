Most viewed blog posts by me (20K+ viewers)
-------------------------------------------

I've been scaling back on blogging this past year and have tried something different instead - [Read-Eval-Print-λove](http://www.readevalprintlove.org).  That said, there were a couple of high-traffic posts on my blog.

1. [10 Technical Papers Every Programmer Should Read (At Least Twice)](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/) -- *My most popular post of 2011 was also my most popular of 2012 and also of 2013 and also of 2014 -- go figure.*

2. [Timothy Hart, Rest in Peace](http://blog.fogus.me/2014/01/27/timothy-hart-rest-in-peace/) -- *Timothy Hart was the father of LISP macros.*


Favorite technical books discovered (and read)
----------------------------------------------

* [Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1435455061/?ie=UTF8&tag=fogus-20) -- *Inform7 is a perspective-altering programming language. It's nearly the pinnacle of languages that are informed (hah) by the types of problems that they're attempting to solve.  Beautiful.*

* [Object Oriented Forth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0125635702/?ie=UTF8&tag=fogus-20) -- *Honestly, I can't think of better tech literature available than those written about Forth.*

* [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Under-Microscope-Illustrated-Internals/dp/1593275277/ref=sr_1_1?tag=fogus-20) -- *I'll honestly say that I went into this book expecting the worst.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I was done that the book is a fairly nice dive into the Ruby internals.  I'm frankly shocked that a book like this was even published, but once again the long tail reigns supreme; much to our benefit.*

* [Programmer avec Scheme](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2841801314/ref=x_gr_w_bb_t1_x?tag=fogus-20) -- *I read this in a marathon 3-days during Strange Loop 2014 thanks to [Nada Amin](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/cv/), who hauled it all the way across the planet for me to read.  I'd really love to get another chance to go through it and digest it, but I did like it very much on my first pass.  My favorite part was that while the prose was French, the code too was "very French" also!*

Favorite non-technical books read
---------------------------------

* [Ulysses](http://www.amazon.com/ULYSSES-illustrated-complete-unabridged-Dubliners-ebook/dp/B00F32YJNY/?tag=fogus-20) by James Joyce -- *I finally got around to reading this and wow am I glad that I did.  It took me a month to read and tended to dominate my other parallel books at the time, but it was worth the effort.  Leopold Bloom is now one of my favorite anti-heroes from fiction.*

* [How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built](http://www.amazon.com/How-Buildings-Learn-Happens-Theyre/dp/0140139966/?tag=fogus-20) -- *It was this book that made me (finally) realize that some of the best programming books are not about programming at all. As a result I've cut back drastically on my "language-specific" programming books[^old] and have sought programming-relevant books instead.*

* [Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics](http://www.amazon.com/FEMINISM-FOR-EVERYBODY-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332/?tag=fogus-20) -- *The most lucid outline of feminism that I've found so far.*

* [Anarchy and Alchemy: The Films of Alejandro Jodorowsky](http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-Alchemy-Alejandro-Jodorowsky-Persistence/dp/1840681454/?tag=fogus-20) -- *I've always been an admirer of Jodorowsky's films and graphic novels, so when I saw the cover I knew that I had to read this.  I was not disappointed.  The book is filled with spoilers, so beware.*

* [Blindness](http://www.amazon.com/Blindness-Harvest-Book-Jose-Saramago/dp/0156007754/?tag=fogus-20) -- *Another book that could have been easily subtitled 'Humans are terrible.'*

* [How to Travel with a Salmon and Other Essays](http://www.amazon.com/Travel-Salmon-Other-Essays-Harvest/dp/015600125X/?tag=fogus-20) -- *I couldn't put this book down.  Eco's wit is impeccable and had me giggling at 2am.*

[^old]: And I've made it a personal goal to limit the "language-specific" books to those written before 1995.
