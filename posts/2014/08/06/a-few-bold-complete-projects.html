<p>One of my favorite bloggers James Hague recently wrote a blog post
entitled <em><a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/35.html">Timidity Does
Not Convince</a></em>. In this relatively short post he managed to get
me thinking about programming languages and their viability in a market
for mindshare, especially with his statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only arguments that hold water, in terms of programming language
suitability, are bold, finished projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of questions about this statement that jump to mind,
the primary of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does “bold” and “finished” mean in the context of this
statement?</li>
<li>What constitutes a “project” in the context of this statement? Is
Mr. Hague talking about applications or can we assume that things like
database and web frameworks are on the table also?</li>
</ul>
<p>For my own purposes I’m going to assume that “bold” means “big and
audacious” and “finished” means “once ran, but not necessarily saw
widespread usage.”</p>
<p>That said, I’d like to share a few of the “bold” projects that I’m
aware of. One of my favorite aspects of the original post is that
Mr. Hague talks about two projects created in two non-mainstream
languages, Pascal and Erlang. Therefore, in this small follow-up<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I’d like to share a few of the bold,
completed projects that I’m aware of in a few interesting languages.</p>
<p><strong>I’d love to see others write similar posts or comments
listing their favorite bold projects in their favorite obscure
languages.</strong></p>
<h2 id="clojure">Clojure</h2>
<p>In the course of <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2014/02/03/i-cognitect/">my consulting work
with Clojure</a> I’ve seen numerous proprietary systems<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
that I’d classify as bold, however I should probably not talk about
those. Instead for Clojure I’d like to offer <a
href="http://www.datomic.com">Datomic</a> as fitting into this category.
Without going into too much ceremony, Datomic is a distributed database
system with an interesting query language and an even more interesting
data model.</p>
<p>Another interesting system that I’d add to Clojure’s credit is the
one that runs <a href="http://getprismatic.com/home">Prismatic</a>. I
don’t know anything about the details of this great service, but I’m
aware that Clojure runs deep.</p>
<h2 id="erlang">Erlang</h2>
<p>Staying on this train of thought, <a
href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> is perhaps the first
document database that I had ever heard of<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I
do not have much personal experience with CouchDB, but it’s made a
splash in a dense market and managed to avoid losing mindshare to the
Nth-mover advantage.</p>
<h2 id="ruby">Ruby</h2>
<p>Just <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">a little web framework</a>
that fueled (and continues to?) billions of dollars in consulting
revenue flowing through the computing industry.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="common-lisp">Common Lisp</h2>
<p>One of my first simulation projects was to help maintain a large
wargame simulation written entirely in Common Lisp. Since I can’t really
talk about that one, I’ll instead point to <a
href="http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">Ron Garret’s classic
tale of Lisp at the Jet Propulsion Labs</a>.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="visual-prolog">Visual Prolog</h2>
<p>I worked for a company once with a very smart guy who worshiped at
the Colmerauerian altar. He was one of those guys who if you walked past
his cubicle he’d grab you and start talking about Prolog. I personally
liked these kinds of conversations, but I can see why some might have
been put off by it. Rather than being a raving blow-hard, the guy
actually created an amazing rule-based system (GUI and all in <a
href="http://www.visual-prolog.com/">Visual Prolog</a>) that was
basically a highly-sophisticated system to help solve the napsack
problem for container ships. It was probably the cleanest Prolog code
that I’ve ever seen and will ever see in my life.</p>

languages?</p>

<li id="fn4"><p>Generally I’d like to avoid web frameworks in this
discussion because the first “large-project” for most modern languages
includes either a build system or a web framework — or both. I include
Rails here because it’s impact was so staggering for a time, relative to
the marketshare of its host language.<a href="#fnref4"
