<p><a href="http://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/">Nick Bentley</a>’s
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68199/catchup">Catchup</a>
is a game that I’ve only recently played, but that has captured my
imagination in a big way. If you’ve read this blog for any significant
amount of time then you might have noticed that I like to talk about <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/tag/langdev/">programming languages and the
process of creating them</a>. With this in mind it should come as no
surprise that the reason that I admire the game Catchup is that
Mr. Bentley has written quite extensively about its <a
href="http://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/tag/catchup/">design,
creation, and evolution</a>. Indeed, most of his thoughts about game
design, with some surgical use of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>, could effectively
stand-in for discussions on programming language design. <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2014/04/19/emergence-and-quality/">I’ve talk
about this kind of synchronicity before</a>, but no where is it more
apparent than in Bentley’s writing.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In a nutshell, Catchup is the epitome of elegance in game design.
It’s a medium-weight game of abstract strategy meaning that it’s not as
complicated as Chess or Go, but it’s got more to offer than say Connect
4, Dots and Boxes, or even <a
href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38545/kamisado">Kamisado</a>
(IMO). I’ve fallen for Catchup in a big way, and I want to share this
joyful game with you.</p>
<p>That said, it’s probably worth talking a little about how to play the
game. I’ve found it very easy to teach, so allow me to try here.</p>

<p><em>Caveat emptor: I am a rank beginner at Catchup. My goal with this
post is to expose a great game and hope others find it compelling enough
to explore themselves.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-play">What you need to play</h2>
<p>You can print out a <a
href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80305/redesigned-ketchup-board">Catchup
board with a scoring track</a> or just use the iOS app (discussed
later). If you go with the meatspace board then you’ll need some small
Go stones or beads of two different colors, 30 of one color and 31 of
the other.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>Catchup is a connection game of majority control on a hexhex5
board[^5] (see the image above) with a very simple set of rules:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first player of the game places 1 stone</li>
<li>On each subsequent turn a player can place 1 or 2 stones</li>
<li>If the size of their largest group grows or becomes the largest
group on the board as a result of their placement(s) then the other
player may place up to 3 stones on the next turn</li>
</ol>
<p>When the board is full the game ends.</p>
<p>And that’s it!</p>
<p><em>note: The image above has a scoring track around the game board
that’s used to track the size of the largest group for each
player.</em></p>
<h3 id="winning">Winning</h3>
<p>The player with the largest group at the end wins. If there’s a tie
for the largest group then the next largest determines the winner, or
the next largest if again there’s a tie, all the way down to the final
group.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Ties in Catchup are not
possible.</p>

<p>Amazingly this simple ruleset belies the fact that the game is quite
deep. In my plays so far at the tabletop and on the phone/tablet have
revealed hints of <a
href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4112/hex">Hex</a> and <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Mudcrack-Y-Craige-Schensted/dp/091101408X/?tag=fogus-20">Y</a>
with a similar feel to the timing tension that I get when playing <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/GMT-Games-0012-Battle-Line/dp/B00153TYIU/?tag=fogus-20">Battle
Line</a>.</p>

<p>Should I connect now? If I don’t I might get cut off there… But if I
do I’ll reveal my plan…</p>

<p>Good fun.</p>
<h2 id="catchup-in-your-devices">Catchup in your devices</h2>
<p>Lately I’ve been playing Catchup on my phone against people around
the world (full disclosure, I appear to be the worst player in the
world). Early this month an adaptation of <a
href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/catchup-abstract-strategy/id718429890?uo=4&amp;mt=8&amp;at=10lazE">Catchup
was released for iOS systems</a> for $1.99. The app looks like this on
my phone:</p>

</figure>
<p>One of the cool things about this app is that it will adjust its own
skill level to match your play. That is, at the beginning it plays very
poorly, but after a few wins it’s quite challenging. Indeed, I’ve
plateaued a bit at level 13 and bounce back and forth between 12 and 13.
This is fine by me because it allows me to always play an AI at my
level. This is a nice feature given that Catchup itself does not have an
obvious handicapping mechanism like Go. I suppose that one could lay
extra stones in the beginning, but I suspect the nature of the game
would change too much for that to be viable.</p>
<p>This adjusting skill feature is almost worth the price alone given
that, in my experience, most game apps have three settings: stoopid,
laughable, and impossible.</p>
<h2 id="simple-strategies-and-observations">Simple strategies and
observations</h2>
<p>While I mentioned that Catchup doesn’t have a natural handicapping
mechanism, it does have a… ah hem… catch up mechanism. That is, the rule
that allows someone to place three stones instead of two allows the
trailing player to get close to the leader quicker than the leader can
widen the gap. If this is done properly then a player can intentionally
trail right up to a critical moment where they can pull ahead for the
lead. This is easier said than done. The whole game is a delicate
balance between trailing and embiggening (a technical term that I just
made up) groups. I still haven’t quite figured it out. I played the
designer once and he made it look super easy, but that’s how those
things go I suppose.</p>
<p>That said, there are basic patterns that help to maximize your group
growth potential while also minimizing your opponent’s. They are as
follows:</p>

<p>The designer, Nick Bentley has written more information about <a
href="http://www.boardgamestrategies.com/blog/gamename/catchup/">basic
Catchup strategies</a> than I can include here.</p>
<h2 id="finis">Finis</h2>
<p>Catchup, unlike <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2014/05/07/games-of-interest-homeworlds/">Homeworlds
before</a> is a game with very simple rules that work together towards
deeper implications. I suppose you could say that it’s a “1-minute to
learn, a lifetime to master” kind of games, but that’s not to imply that
it requires a lifetime of study to master like Chess and Go. Instead,
it’s a relatively new game, so its depths have yet been plumbed. This is
an exciting opportunity from my perspective. It certainly doesn’t hurt
that Catchup is a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>Consider trying it out.</p>
