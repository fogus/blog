It's been a long time coming, but I've finally put the finishing touches on the latest installment of Read-Eval-Print-λove, the Lisp/Little Languages zine.

In the latest installment I discuss the roots of Lisp and dive fairly deeply into an implementation of John McCarthy's original vision as described in his seminal paper "Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine, Part I."

Some important links are below:

Remember that all installments are considered living documents and can and will change for the better based on feedback from readers.
