<p>A few months ago I discovered a game called Homeworlds, and have
fallen deeply in love. Homeworlds is a game of intergalactic conquest
where ships of differing capabilities battle for supremacy in star
systems…. or rather, it’s a <a
href="http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids">Looney Pyramids</a>
abstract strategy game invented by <a
href="http://www.ginohn.com/wunder201005/games/">John Cooper</a> <a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> (a designer whom I admire greatly)
akin to Chess. It’s a great game.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll talk a little about the rules of the game, some
basic strategies, and wrap up with some miscellaneous thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Caveat emptor: I am a rank beginner at Homeworlds. My goal with
this post is to expose a great game and hope others find it compelling
enough to explore themselves.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-rules-of-homeworlds-in-brief">The rules of Homeworlds, in
brief</h2>
<p>Homeworlds is a game for 2-6 players, but since I’ve only played the
2-player version (called Binary Homeworlds) I’ll focus on the rules for
that. This is just an overview of the rules. A more comprehensive
rule-set can be found on <a
href="http://www.ginohn.com/wunder201005/games/Homeworlds/HomeworldsRules.html">John
Cooper’s Homeworlds page</a>.</p>

role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>Two players</li>
<li>Playing time: 15 minutes to an hour</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-setup">The setup</h3>
<p>Select any two pieces of any sizes and colors to represent your
<em>homeworld</em>, and a third piece of any size and color to represent
your first <em>starship</em>. Place your two homeworld pieces in an
upright stack in front of you. Place your ship next to your homeworld,
lying down and pointing directly away from you. The remaining pieces not
used in the initial setup can be placed to the side.</p>
<p>It will look like this:</p>
<figure>

alt="setup" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">setup</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During the game, upright pieces will represent <em>star-systems</em>,
and pieces that are lying down will represent starships that occupy
these systems. Additionally, starships that face away from you are yours
and those that point at you belong to your opponent.</p>
<h3 id="the-goal">The goal</h3>
<p>There are three ways to win in Homeworlds:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Eliminate all of your opponent’s starships</li>
<li>Eliminate all of your opponent’s starships in their homeworld</li>
<li>Destroy your opponent’s star-system</li>
</ol>
<p>To achieve these goals you’ll need to move, create, and take control
of starships using the rules described briefly next.</p>
<h3 id="the-gameplay">The gameplay</h3>
<p>On each player’s turn they can take a single action consisting of the
following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform an action pertaining to the color of one of your ships or an
occupied star-system</li>
<li>Sacrifice a starship for 1-3 extra actions pertaining to its
color</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see, all actions are color-specific. The actions associated
with each color are as follows.</p>
<h4 id="color-actions">Color actions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blue</strong> - trade a starship of a certain size for
another starship of the same size of a different color, as long as the
starship you’re trading is in the same system as a blue color and the
wanted color is available in the global inventory</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> - Move a ship to a connected star-system,
as long as the starship you’re moving is in the same system as a yellow
color. Star-systems are only connected if they have pyramids of
different sizes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Green</strong> - Build a ship of the smallest size for
any color you desire in the global inventory, as long as the starship
you’re building is in the same system as a green color and the wanted
color is available in the global inventory</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Red</strong> - Attack an opponent’s ship in the same
star-system as the red color, as long as the starship you’re attacking
is the same size or smaller as a starship that you control in the same
system</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As shown, most of the actions associated with the colors directly
depend on and manipulate the global inventory. That being the case, most
games of Homeworlds revolve around the players trying to gain control of
one or more colors and sizes in the global inventory. While eliminating
your enemy is the ultimate goal, that goal cannot be met if you’re
unable to perform certain actions.</p>
<h4 id="catastrophe">Catastrophe</h4>
<p>The final rule to mention is called the <em>catastrophe</em> rule. On
their turn, a player can declare a catastrophe in a star-system if there
are 4 or more of the same color in that star-system. When a catastrophe
occurs all stars and starships of that color are removed from the system
and returned to the global inventory. This is a powerful technique that
is critical to keep in mind lest you find yourself with less ships or a
missing start in your homeworld.</p>
<h2 id="simple-strategies-and-observations">Simple strategies and
observations</h2>
<p>I mentioned in the beginning of this post that I have fallen in love
with this game. Sadly however, it seems as if my love is an unrequited
love indeed. Since my first game in January 2014 I managed to lose in
every conceivable manner. Perhaps this speaks to the depth of Homeworlds
that a person can play a dozen times and never lose the same way
twice.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CHrzDtCyp7U/U2pPXVl_zaI/AAAAAAAAARs/tT_llY2LTeE/w600-h800-no/hwsdg.png" height="65%" width="65%"></p>
<p>The first thing that a player realizes when starting to play
Homeworlds is that at any given moment there are a dizzying array of
options available. However, there are a few general principles to keep
in mind in the early games that will help.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first few moves for both players will tend to be exactly the
same, every time (i.e. build a small green, then trade it for another
small of a color not in your homeworld).</p></li>
<li><p>If you do not start the game with the color blue somewhere in
your homeworld then you’ll experience much pain in your game. This
especially holds true for beginners.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do not start the game with the color green somewhere in
your homeworld then you’ll probably lose your game. This especially
holds true for beginners.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to get at least one of each color in each system that you
occupy. This will help you to diversify color, avoid being shut out of
colors, and to avoid catastrophes.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems to be a game where it would be difficult to develop a
personal style. From what I’ve seen, the choice of homeworld sizes and
colors and the played pieces in the early game tend to dictate how the
rest of the game will play out.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a shame that the black pyramids (in the Treehouse colors)
are not used. My son and I have toyed around with using black as black
holes and cloaking devices, but neither has stuck and both add
extra-fiddly to the game.</p></li>
<li><p>The players on <a
href="http://superdupergames.org/">SuperDuperGames</a> (SDG) have been
playing this game for many years, so it’s tough coming into that
community as a n00b. That said, there are many helpful players, but if
you plan to learn how to play on SDG, prepare for a trail by fire. (or
ping me, username: fogus)</p></li>
<li><p>Playing the game on SDG feels very different from using actual
pyramids on a tabletop. For me, using real pieces makes the options much
harder to visualize.</p></li>
