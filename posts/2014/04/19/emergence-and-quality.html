<p>Although the blogging bug has not hit me lately, I have been thinking
about bloggable topics. One interesting topic that I’m mulling around in
my mind at the moment is the idea of emergence in programming language
design. The catalyst for this focus was my recent research into the
processes that board game designers use to create games.</p>
<h2 id="emergent-strategies-and-idioms">Emergent strategies and
idioms</h2>
<p>First, one of my favorite designers <a
href="http://www.koryheath.com/">Kory Heath</a>, has extensive design
notes for two of my favorite games <a
href="http://www.koryheath.com/zendo/design-history/">Zendo</a> <a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and <a
href="http://www.koryheath.com/uptown/design-history/">Uptown</a>. <a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In both design histories you’ll see
themes that are very reminiscent of the same themes that pop up when
talking to language designers about their creations.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
It’s eerie the parallels between the two worlds. I suppose this parallel
explains my <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2013/10/31/open-source-boardcarddice-game-design/">recent
interest in the process of board/card/dice game</a> design.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>A point that I particularly like espoused by Mr. Heath is that idea
of <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061119095146/http:/wunderland.com/WTS/Kory/JoEGD/Discussion/heath14.html">emergent
strategies</a>. The idea of emergent strategy reminds me of programming
language idioms. Idioms in languages come about for various reasons, but
the best idioms emerge from the language itself. That is, the strongest
idioms emerge during the use of the language and play on and highlight
the language’s strengths<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. It’s almost as if the language
itself begs for a given idiom to arise. It’s a topic I want to ponder
much more – in both game design<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and language design.</p>
<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
<p>The second topic that I’ve been thinking about concerns quality.
There is a very interesting discussion by Daniel Solis and (again) Kory
Heath about differing approaches to achieving quality in their designs.
There are many nuances in play during the discussion, but I hope that a
representational summary is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heath: Hold back a design until it feels perfect</li>
<li>Solis: Quality will emerge (there’s that word again) from
quantity</li>
</ul>
<p>You can watch the video below to regain some of the nuance, but I
believe that summarizes the discussion fairly well.</p>

</iframe>
<p>This dichotomy really hits home for me, especially in the way that I
view, and have viewed, open source software. That is, until about
13-months ago I believed that more was better in open-source and by
releasing package after package I could contribute a body of work that
was not only useful in isolation, but could point to an underlying
philosophy of design. However, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E2CoObAaPQ">after spending nearly
a year on a single system</a> my viewpoint on the matter has changed
completely. That is, my view now is that I want to hold off on code and
designs until I feel like they tell a story by themselves.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
Practically speaking this means that I’ll be releasing far less software
than I have in the past. I still want to contribute to open source of
course, and am still active in <a
href="http://www.clojure.org">Clojure</a>, <a
href="http://datomic.com">Datomic</a>, and <a
href="https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib">_.contrib</a>;
however for my own designs I want to strive for something more.</p>

I’ve come to the realization that I can do better. That’s not to say
that I’m disappointed in its design, indeed it could be useful to many
people. Instead, to release Zeder would put me in a position where I
would feel compelled to maintain it for the next X number of years, and
that is something that I cannot bring myself to do with a system that I
do not believe is perfect.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
