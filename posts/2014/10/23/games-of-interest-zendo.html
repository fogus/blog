<p>I recently held a <a
href="https://github.com/strangeloop/StrangeLoop2014/wiki/Unsessions#zendo--the-scientific-method-in-a-box">Zendo
unsession</a> at the 2014 Strange Loop conference in St. Louis and
described the game as <a
href="http://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/zendo-as-a-tool-for-teaching-the-scientific-method/">the
scientific method in a box</a>. While perhaps too general, I believed
that the <a
href="http://okasaki.blogspot.com/2008/02/games-for-programmers-zendo.html">tech,
mathematical, and scientific-minded crowd at Strange Loop would
appreciate the game</a> very much. However, before I talk about the
unsession, allow me to take a few moments to talk about the game
itself.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-zendo">Introduction to Zendo</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendo_(game)">Zendo</a> is a
game of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning">inductive
logic</a>. One person plays the <em>Master</em> and creates a
<em>rule</em> that dictates the layout of tiny installments of
crystalline pyramids or other such trinkets. The other players then
construct their own arrangements (called <em>koans</em>) in hopes of
learning which follow the rule (marked in white) and which do not
(marked in black). Gradually the secret rule is uncovered by the players
in a cooperative<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> realization of truth.</p>
<p>For example, the rule that dictates the following arrangements is
<em>No two pieces can touch.</em></p>

<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>40-50+ building pieces. I prefer <a
href="http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids">Looney Pyramids</a>,
but something like Legos would suffice too. I’ll assume pyramids for the
purposes of this post.</p></li>
<li><p>A bunch of stones or other small bits; preferably of three
different colors. Stones of two colors will be used as “marking stones”
for the master and “answer stones” for the players, and the third
colored stones used as “guessing stones.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The pyramids are placed within reach of all of the players and the
game is ready to start.</p>
<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
<p>The game starts with the Master devising a secret rule such as “a
koan must contain an orange piece” or “the number of pyramids must be an
even number.” Devising rules that will not frustrate the players takes
some practice, so it’s best to start simple<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>,
especially if the other players are new to the game. That said, the
Master then builds two structures: one that follows the secret rule and
one that does not. Once done, the game can begin.</p>
<h4 id="player-turns">Player turns</h4>
<p>On each turn a player arranges their pyramids into a structure
(called a “koan”) and says either “master” or “mondo.” By calling
“master” the player is simply asking the Master to mark if their
structure follows the secret rule or not. When they call “mondo” they
are effectively asking for a peer review of their structure. What this
means is that each player hides either a black or white stone in their
hand corresponding to whether or not they think the new structure
follows the rule as they understand it.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The
Master also hides a stone and once ready all of the players
simultaneously reveal their stones. Whomever matches the color of the
Master’s stone gets a new guessing stone. Before moving to the next
player’s turn, the current player may choose to spend a guessing stone
to make a verbal guess at the secret rule.</p>
<h4 id="ending-the-game">Ending the game</h4>
<p>If a player guesses the rule correctly on their turn the game is over
and that player gets a point. However, if the player incorrectly guesses
then the master must build a contradicting structure. That is, the
Master must build a structure that simultaneously follows the secret
rule while also contradicting the player’s guess. If at any time the
Master is unable to build a contradictory structure then the guessing
player wins the game and gets a point. For the purposes of Zendo,
guessing a rule that cannot be disproven is as good as guessing the
original secret rule.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Until a player guesses the secret rule the previously built
structures should remain on the play area so that players can look them
over in hopes of discovering the patterns. Zendo is great fun and I’ve
found it to be a hit amongst scientifically-minded people.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The
rules above can’t express the joy of this game, but <a
href="https://al3x.net/2012/04/09/the-game.html">Alex Payne once wrote
about Zendo in such a way that more appropriately gives the sense of
what it’s like to play Zendo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-zendo-session-at-strange-loop-2014">A Zendo session at Strange
Loop 2014</h2>
<p>Prior to attending <a
href="https://thestrangeloop.com/archive/2014">Strange Loop 2014</a> I
decided to try running a <a
href="https://github.com/strangeloop/StrangeLoop2014/wiki/Unsessions#zendo--the-scientific-method-in-a-box">Zendo
unsession</a> one of the nights of the conference. I had ~10 people sign
up on the conference site and brought enough pyramids sufficient for
~4-5 groups. My session was due to start at 9pm and due to very slow
service at a restaurant I arrived about 5 minutes late. The room was
filled, but I suspected that the previous session had run over. I
immediately spoke up and asked “how many people are here to discover
Zendo?” Every single hand went up…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That is, ~30-35 hands went up.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I was in trouble.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with an emphasis on “thank”, a couple (Danielle and
David) immediately stood up and pulled out a huge stash of pyramids!
They also knew and loved the game and offered to help. Once we ran
through the rules, we split up the pyramids, split up the Masters and
started. Both Danielle and David ran a table each and managed to teach
their players the traditional Zendo rules as outlined above. However, as
I was Mastering 3 tables to start<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, I went with a
simplified version of the rules and jumped from table to table.</p>

</figure>
<p>Zendo was a immediate hit. The players, though most were new to
Zendo, instantly “got it.” There were constant congratulations on
finding the rules and echoes of “let’s play another.” I mastered about 9
games between 3 tables, but soon was able to relax, vet some rules, and
just sit and play once the other players felt confident to be Master. I
still jumped from table to table to play a rule or two (and got in ~20
games by night’s end) but after a while the tables were off and running
without intervention. It was a thing of beauty.</p>

<p>I stayed until the end of the last game … which ended at about 1am.
That’s 4 hours of Zendo played and enjoyed by 40-50 people (all told),
many whom were new to the game.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Zendo can be as adversarial or as cooperative as you
like. I prefer to play in such a way that the players feel like they’re
all working towards discovery. Whenever I play master I like to
encourage the players openly discuss their ideas with the other players.

the contradicting koans to be an interesting challenge. Likewise, in the
rare occasion where I’m unable to disprove a guess, it’s always fun to

it could have been done.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
