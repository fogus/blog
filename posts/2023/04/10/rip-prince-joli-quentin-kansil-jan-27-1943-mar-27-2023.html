<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joli_Quentin_Kansil">Prince
Joli Quentin Kansil</a> was a renaissance man amongst game designers. A
world traveler by desire, his roots (when he planted them) were in
Philippines as an English teacher. I’d like to think that his designs
are the kinds of games that might have been invented by “the most
interesting man in the world.” In addition to designing games, he was
also a board game publisher, an accomplished Bridge and Backgammon
player and promoter, a teacher, an author, an <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060710031108/http://www.indochinegame.com/board_games/other_projects.html">inventor
of alternative alphabets and calendars</a>, a restless traveler, and a
member of Hawaiian royalty by marriage. To those who knew him and
corresponded with him, he was generous with his time and thoughtful in
his interactions.</p>

<p>Joli Quentin Kansil passed away on March 27th, 2023 – two months
after his 80th birthday.</p>
<p>Kansil’s design are quaint by the standards of modern design and are
closer to traditional pub games than the games that flood the
Kickstarter scene, but I always admired their ingenuity and drew deep
inspiration from them for my own (occasional) designs. In this post,
I’ll run through some of the games that I’ve played as an homage to a
designer whose like we will never see again.</p>

<h2 id="bridgette">Bridgette</h2>
<p><a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2758/bridgette">Bridgette</a>
is a Bridge variant for two-players and one of the few games inducted
into the <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100417062722/http://www.gamesmagazine-online.com/gameslinks/hallofame.html">Games
Magazine Hall of Fame</a>. Bridgette was admired among hobby game
designers (Alan Moon was once a huge fan) and Bridge players alike. If
there is a game that could pair well with scotch then Bridgette is that
game. There have been many variants over the years, but the pinnacle of
2-player Bridge is realized in the “Bridgette Showdown” edition, which
was the last commercial release. Bridge players know that the depth of
game-play comes in the meta-language of bidding and the way that players
use it to garner information about opponent and partner hands. The real
depth of Bridge comes in the form of Duplicate play where teams all play
with the same prefab hands and try to best each other’s score with them.
Having experienced Duplicate play first-hand I’ll say that it’s tense
and riveting in all the right ways. Bridgette cannot duplicate that
particular aspect of Bridge, but it does a fantastic job of retaining a
language of hand exposure in ways that no other 2-player Bridge that
I’ve played before or since discovering Bridgette.</p>
<h2 id="krakatoa">Krakatoa</h2>
<p><a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1306/krakatoa">Krakatoa</a> is
an odd dice game with set collection and a dexterity element where
players throw dice to change the values of previously rolled dice and
build scoring sets. The idea of crashing dice into other dice to change
their values in hopes of scoring higher is indeed bonkers, but such a
crazy activity is highly amenable to trash talking and friendly banter.
You have to like dice games to enjoy this one and if you’re interested
then I recommend trying to find the 1st edition rules as they make for a
more exciting game.</p>
<h2 id="grand-slam-baseball">Grand Slam Baseball</h2>
<p><a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4777/grand-slam-baseball">Grand
Slam Baseball</a> is a variation of <a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21682/card-baseball">Sid
Sackson’s Card Baseball</a> that uses the trick-taking resolution and
simultaneous reveal from Marrakesh to determine player outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="solitaire-for-two">Solitaire for Two</h2>
<p><a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2602/solitaire-two">Solitaire
for Two</a> is a variant of Klondike, but with six suits and beautifully
clickty-clacking tiles.</p>
<h2 id="montage">Montage</h2>
<p>It took me forever to finally get 4-players able and willing to play
<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5243/montage">Montage</a>,
but when it finally happened it was a hit. Like most JQK games, Montage
is quirk-city to the max. The idea is that you’re using a symbolic
language of colors to signal to your teammate a secret word without
providing too much information that the other team will know what the
word is. It’s weird… but it works! The game was eventually reworked into
a game called <a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4072/knock-word">¡Knock-on-Word!</a>
that uses many of the same principles but with more streamlined
play.</p>
<h2 id="whats-my-word">What’s My Word</h2>
<p><a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4079/whats-my-word">What’s My
Word</a> is a near perfect word deduction game that’s reminiscent of
Mastermind but not prone to killer tactics. The game is clearly a
predecessor to the ever-popular Wordle.</p>
<h2 id="marrakesh">Marrakesh</h2>
<p>Finally, <a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/685/marrakesh">Marrakesh</a>
is the strangest Kansil design of all, and the most inspiring to me.
This is a distillation of Backgammon’s bearing off phase, with bluffing,
trick-taking, and memory involved. The game centers around the
Backgammon mechanic of bearing off pieces but mixes in a simultaneous
trick-taking element to resolve play and set the bounds of possible
maneuvering. The matches start quite random with some wild swings, but
as the match progresses you start to gain more information about the
cards left in play. I really like that about the game. Marrakesh is
truly an oddball game, but I find it quite endearing. Indeed, the
premise sounds like a bizarre Frankenstein’s Monster… and it is… but
that’s not a bad thing. My favorite aspect is the gradual revelation of
the contents of the draw deck as rounds are played. This is something
that I have tried to emulate in some of my own card game designs.</p>
<p>Joli Quentin Kansil was a truly unique game designer and free-thinker
and I think that he would have fit right into the guest lineup of the
old Art Bell Show. The world lacks truly unique people and as a result
is much the darker now that this shining light has left us.</p>
