<h1 class="title">Pyramid Game Designs</h1>

<p>Like most players of games, I have had ideas for my own designs over
the years. My medium of choice for realizing design ideas are typically
existing game systems. By “system” I mean a set of pieces that do not,
in themselves, constitute a game but instead provide a flexible
framework for creating new games.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> One of my favorite game
systems are the lovely <a
href="https://www.looneylabs.com/pyramids-home">Looney Pyramids</a> from
<a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/">Looney Labs</a>. The following
games were designed over the course of years and most are still WiP.
After the list I’ll share some meta ideas about game design for the
pyramids themselves and in general. (sorted in order of my favorite)</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p><a

been an obsession for years and is still an ongoing process. I’ve landed
on a serviceable mechanism but I still think that it could be better. I

powers could be better.</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/cydonia">Cydonia</a> – <em>I
also think that this is a good game too, but the number of pyramids

simpler.</em></p></li>

</ol>
<p>Nothing earth-shattering in these games for sure, but all in all not
too bad IMO. There are a few games on this list that I think I can see
myself (and others hopefully) actually enjoying. This to me is a
success. Additionally, I learned some valuable lessons over the past
year that I’d like to share.</p>
<h2 id="game-ideas-are-worthless">Game ideas are worthless</h2>
<p>Over the years I dreamt up dozens of game ideas that didn’t turn into
games. That is, there’s a huge distinction between coming up with an
idea for a game and actually creating a game that anyone would want to
play. Additionally, once you’ve come up with an idea that may be
playable, there’s no guarantee that anyone will want to play it. Even
further, even if you come up with an idea that someone might want to
play, then play-testing might highlight some fatal flaws or, at best,
sticking points. By this I mean that I’ve come up with plenty of other
pyramid games…</p>
<ul>
<li>Karankaron: Zendo, but for sound</li>
<li>Pedestal: a blind bidding game</li>
<li>Pyrametto: Coloretto, but for pyramids</li>
<li>Hollywood Babylon: Babylon, but for pyramids</li>
<li>Helmet: a 2p abstract checkers-like</li>
<li>Panopticon: a 2p abstract racing game</li>
<li>A Kamisado-like using the “controlled roll”</li>
<li>Minimax: a 2p engine-building game</li>
<li>A tile-laying game using pyramids and Iota cards</li>
<li>and many others not worth mentioning</li>
</ul>
<p>…but in every case writing out the rules and/or play-testing exposed
some deep flaw –“boring” being the most prevalent. Therefore, it struck
me that ideas alone are worthless and when they turn out to have been
bad from the start they should be thrown away. Eventually, more will pop
up to replace them.</p>
<p>Additionally, you’ll notice that about half of the games listed are
derivative. One thing that I’ve found is that it’s super-easy to take a
game that already exists and “adapt” it to pyramids. However, often I’ve
found that the vehicle of the pyramids doesn’t always fit the original
game. Instead, either the derivation doesn’t work at all or the pyramids
themselves inform a mutation of the original design to the extent that
it’s practically a new game (e.g. Malice above). I think that this is
likely the most important lesson that I’ve learned in the past year.
That is, if you’re designing an pyramid game then listen to the
pyramids… they’ll help guide you, and wow are they lovely guides
indeed.</p>
<h2 id="play-testing-is-a-pain-for-all-involved">Play-testing is a pain
for all involved</h2>
<p>I won’t harp on this point too much, but I will say a few words.
First, I have a problem with play-testing. That is, I always feel very
timid asking someone to play my own designs. I always feel like I’m
burdening them in some way. Thankfully, I have two awesome kids who’re
always willing to play my games, no matter how bad they are. Even more
lucky for me is that they are not shy about shooting down my designs
when they are truly boring. That said, I still have a hard time asking
people outside of my sphere of influence to help me to play-test.</p>
<h2 id="writing-rules-is-hard">Writing rules is hard</h2>
<p>I’ve written a few books and so when it was time to start writing
rules for these games I was confident, but was quickly humbled. Of the
entire game design process I still think that writing lucid rules for
even the most simple of games is the hardest. Writing programming books
does not translate to game rules sadly. I’m still not sure that I’ve
even risen to the level of mediocre in this regard. However, I’ve found
time and time again that writing down rules, even very early on, is a
great way to find problems in the design itself. A few times (and more
as I got more experience) the act of simplifying the words used to
express the rules led to the simplification of the designs themselves.
In fact, I plan to go back to the earliest designs and simplify the
rules in hopes that I can find opportunities to simplify the games
themselves.</p>
<h2 id="when-in-doubt-volcano-scoring">When in doubt… Volcano
scoring</h2>
<p>Almost as hard as writing rules is coming up with fair scoring
mechanisms. Indeed, devising solid scoring is directly antithetical to
having a problem with asking people to play-test your games. That is,
very often (or so I’ve read) scoring mechanisms are finely tuned via a
piece-wise change process occurring over the course of many many many
play-tests. None of my designs have gone through a process like this.
Thankfully for me <a
href="https://www.looneylabs.com/content/volcano">Volcano</a> scoring
already exists, and it usually works right out of the box, it’s simple,
and has been in rotation in pyramid games for 20+ years. Perhaps when/if
these games get more plays I’ll move away from Volcano scoring in those
that use it, but for now I consider it a nice starting point.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal-of-game-design">The goal of game design</h2>
<p>Finally, game design for me is less a goal and more a vehicle for
sharpening my mind in various ways. Certainly, it would be wonderful to
create a game that gained massive popularity, but if that happens at all
it’ll be an accident.</p>
<p>I hope that you’ve enjoyed this post. Please feel free to share your
own designs and thought-processes in the comments.</p>
