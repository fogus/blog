by Walter J.C. Murray - <em>If you liked Walden by Thoreau then you may
like Copsford. The book is a memoir of Murray attempting to life a
rustic life selling wild herbs and waging war on a rat infestation. I
couldn’t put it down.</em></li>

the Seventh</a></strong> by Baron Corvo - <em>Frederic Rolfe, aka Baron
Corvo, was a troubled author who, in-between his limitless bouts of
drama, created some beautiful works of fiction. Chief among his books is
this tale of an unknown Catholic priest who suddenly rises to Pope.
Rolfe was a fallen priest who used the narrative to invoke revenge on
the Catholics and institutions that spurned him.</em></li>
<li><strong><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Jade-New-Critical/dp/1614981264/?tag=fogus-20">The
Book of Jade</a></strong> by David Park Barnitz - <em>This is a book of
decadent poetry that takes highlights the depths of morbid beauty that
fin de siècle was famous for. There was a time in my youth when I
discovered Baudelaire’s <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Fleurs-Du-Mal-Charles-Baudelaire/dp/0879234628/?tag=fogus-20">Les

Wall</a></strong> by Marlen Haushofer - <em>The book follows an unnamed
chracter who finds herself trapped behind an invisible barrier
surrounding a tract of land at the same moment that (seemingly) the
world outside dies. The story follows her day to day trials of survival
and goes deep into her self-realization as possibly the last human on
earth. Fair warning. When I say it follows her activities I really mean
it. It often goes moment to moment tracing her daily routines and
thoughts. I personally enjoyed that depth view but others waiting for
“something to happen” may not. The book is a masterclass of exploration
of motherhood and my book of the year.</em></li>

basic implementation of my own version but have gotten side-tracked by
interesting meta considerations.</em></li>

- <em>Concurrent to the Forth studies I’ve gone back to looking at its
more functional cousin Joy. Much of the same meta-considerations have
gotten in the way but I found it much easier to spike a PoC for Joy.
I’ve been playing around with the idea of local binding via some sort of
stack destructuring but haven’t fleshed out the edge-cases yet. More to
