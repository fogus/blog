<p>Once upon a time I was deep into the MD/DC/VA area punk scene, and
believe it or not I played in my share of bands and participated in my
share of punk shows – both in the crowd and sometimes even on stage. I
look back on this time fondly, but to be honest I can’t say that I ever
contributed any song to the universe of music that was worth listening
to. That said, while I can’t claim to have been a talented song-writer,
like many aspiring musicians I did discover my fair share of riffs along
the way.</p>
<p>A riff is an interesting little musical phrase that one often comes
across whilst playing around with a guitar in a casual fashion. Very
often riffs form the seeds of what becomes fully-realized songs.
Sometimes these songs are good and sometimes they’re not, but in most
cases they are grown like crystals from the original musical fragment
found on the fret-board. For musicians, both practicing and aspiring,
the riff represents a universe of potential out of which any number of
potential works of musical art may spawn.</p>
<p>A few years ago I devised a phrase that I called <a
href="https://blog.fogus.me/2015/02/16/code-painting/">Code Painting</a>
describing source code that: told a story, was usually not generally
useful, was beautifully abstract, and created in the spirit of
exploration. Unlike a code painting, a code riff is more atomic and
often addresses a singular notion. If I were to characterize the
attributes of a code riff then perhaps the following will suffice:</p>
<ul>
<li>A code riff exists independent to a project narrative</li>
<li>A code riff need not be useful</li>
<li>A code riff is often “found” during the act of playful programming
or sprung forth from one’s mind</li>
<li>A code riff should be beautiful, abstract, and as amusing if
possible</li>
<li>A code riff should invoke <a
href="https://blog.fogus.me/2013/09/04/a-ha-ha-ha-aah/">Huh? A ha! Ha
ha!</a> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In my time I’ve created my share of code riffs; some that inspired
something more and some still ripe with potential. If you’re interested
in some code riffs then a few are available on Github as <a
href="https://github.com/fogus/tori-lisp">Tori Lisp</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/fogus/evalive">Evalive</a>, and <a
href="https://github.com/fogus/unfix">Unfix</a> and additionally the
<code>break</code> macro in chapter 17 of <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Clojure-Michael-Fogus/dp/1617291412?tag=fogus-20">The
Joy of Clojure</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a Clojure code riff from a presentation that I gave many years
ago called “The Magnificent Seven”:</p>
<pre><code>(def NIL ((fn [x y] (if (= x y) x)) = (= = =)))

(def CAR (fn [[h & _]] h))
(def CDR  (fn [[_ & t]] t))

(def CONS
  (fn [h t]
    (fn ([] h)
        ([_] t))))

(def FIRST (fn [s] (s)))
(def REST (fn [s] (s NIL)))

(FIRST (CONS 1 (CONS 2 NIL)))
;;=> 1

(FIRST (REST (CONS 1 (CONS 2 NIL)))
;;=> 2
</code></pre>
<p>Do you have any code riffs to share?</p>
