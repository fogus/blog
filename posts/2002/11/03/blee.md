Iíve often thought of what it means to worship at altar of tears -- I've often wondered of the meaning of the art of crying -- The art of tears.  Iíve often wondered over the healing powers of the cry while lamenting the death of the father and the corruption of the womb and cried.  There were protesters in my neighborhood recently and of the multitudes there is but one who knows exactly why the IMF is evil, but not a soul takes this eunuch seriously.  It knows the art of crying.  The vicar in a tutu knows as well.  King Mob knows as does the Montauk Beast and Preston B. Nichols.  The MeMe generation knows.  As do I.  Do you?<br/>
