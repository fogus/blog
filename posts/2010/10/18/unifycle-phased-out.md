A month ago I [announced a unification library for Clojure named Unifycle](http://blog.fogus.me/2010/09/27/unifycle-a-unification-library-for-clojure/).  A month later I am phasing that library out in favor of [this new unification library for Clojure](http://github.com/clojure/core.unify).  If you have adopted Unifycle or plan to, then please keep an eye on the other location.  More information to come.

...[and here is that information, from Rich Hickey himself.](http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/c40ff3e876b4b370/f6fcb96fd695635c?show_docid=f6fcb96fd695635c)
