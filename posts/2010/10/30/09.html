<p><em><a
href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/10/27/divisibility-by-7/">John
Cook’s 7 post</a> reminded me of 9</em></p>
<p><br />It is 1am and I cannot sleep; therefore I think (which may be
at the root of my problem). For your entertainment, I give you the
number nine. I am currently obsessed with 9, and this blog represents a
small fraction of the reasons why. <br /> <br />The number nine has
magical properties. First, as everyone knows in order to determine if a
number is divisible by 9, one need only to add its digits (and those of
its sum recursively). If they equal nine, then you have your
answer.<br />
<br /> <br />17 =&gt; 1 + 7 = 8 :( <br />18 =&gt; 1 + 8 = 9 :) <br />55
=&gt; 5 + 5 = 10 :( <br />54 =&gt; 5 + 4 = 9 :) <br />5994 =&gt; 5 + 9 +
9 + 4 = 27 =&gt; 2 + 7 = 9 :) <br />48,762 =&gt; 4 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 27
=&gt; 2 + 7 = 9 :) <br />49,650 =&gt; 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 0 = 24 =&gt; 2 + 4
= 6 :( <br /> <br />… and so on. <br /> <br />There is also something
called the beautiful table of nines. One can construct this table simply
by started at 1 and continuing forever by multiplying each successive
number by 9. Another way to construct this table is to realize that
there is a pattern underlying its construction. That is, if you look at
the right-most number in this table (n x 1 table that is) you will see
that it starts at 9 and counts down to 0. Likewise the left-most n
columns start at 1 if there is no digit to their left (otherwise they
start at 0) and count up to 9. Visually, this looks like: <br /> <br />1
x 9 = 9 <br />2 x 9 = 18 <br />3 x 9 = 27 <br />. <br />. <br />.
<br />31 x 9 = 279 <br />32 x 9 = 288 <br />33 x 9 = 297 <br />. <br />.
<br />. <br /><i>inf</i> <br /> <br />Further, 9 can be used to check
the result of any addition. That is, taken any two numbers and their
supposed sum, we first take the modulo of each of those numbers to 9. If
the sum of the first two remainders <em>does not equal</em> the final
remainder, then the supposed sum was likewise incorrect. Likewise, this
method can be used to check multiplication by taking the aforementioned
remainders and multiplying them. If the product of the first two does
not equal the final remainder, then the original product was not
correct. For example: <br /> <br />52 + 67 = 119 <br />52 % 9 = 7
<br />67 % 9 = 4 <br />119 % 9 = 2 <br />7 + 4 = 11 !?!? <br />
<br />This is OK. When the sum of the first two remainders equals a
number &gt; 9, then the remainder for the original sum represents the
offset from 9. In the above example, the offset from 9 is 2 which is
therefore 11. An example that illustrates the original premise would be:
<br /> <br />33 + 11 = 44 <br />33 % 9 = 6 <br />11 % 9 = 2 <br />44 % 9
= 8 <br />6 + 2 = 8 :) <br /> <br />For the case of multiplication, the
same principles hold true: <br /> <br />10 x 12 = 120 <br />10 % 9 = 1
<br />12 % 9 = 3 <br />120 % 9 = 3 <br />1 x 3 = 3 :) <br /> <br />For
very large numbers, it may be impractical to find the modulo to 9.
Instead, one can throw out all of the nines embedded in the numbers and
use the remaining numbers to validate the sums and products. What the
Hell does that mean? To elaborate: <br /> <br />1567 + 727 = 2294
<br />5 + 6 + 7 = 18 =&gt; 1 + 8 = 9 &lt;– throw away – left with 1
<br />7 + 2 = 9 &lt;– throw away – left with 7 <br />9 &lt;– throw away
– left with 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 <br />1 + 7 = 8 :) <br /> <br />The same goes
for multiplication. However, there is a caveat when one of the numbers
is a multiple of 9. I leave that exercise to the reader… I’m tired.</p>
