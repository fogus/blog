I've been thinking of a code metric designed to measure how much code it takes any given language to write a program that does nothing.  Don't misunderstand me and think that I mean a `Hello World` program with 64K exclamation points tacked onto the end.  What I mean is finding that critical point where a program crosses from 'doing nothing' to 'doing something useful'.  I tried to express this idea in my [CUFP talk](http://blog.fogus.me/2010/10/02/naivete-vs-experience/), but I failed miserably and it came off as a joke.  Sadly I ran out of time before expanding on it.  I have no idea if this is worth exploring further, but I'll probably keep thinking about it nonetheless.
