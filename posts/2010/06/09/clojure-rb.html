<p>Call me crazy, but it seems that there is a large influx of Ruby
programmers exploring the Clojure programming language. Based on the
results of <a
href="http://muckandbrass.com/web/display/~cemerick/2010/06/07/Results+from+the+State+of+Clojure,+Summer+2010+Survey">Chas
Emerick’s great State of Clojure - Summer 2010 survey</a>, 17% of
surveyed Clojure users come from a Ruby background. Based on observed
trends, I expect that percentage to grow in the next round. But why?</p>
<h2 id="an-opening-of-minds">An Opening of Minds</h2>
<p><a href="http://paulgraham.com">Paul Graham’s</a> seminal essays on
Lisp were an incredible boon for reawakening the public’s interest in
the language. I imagine many programmers, like myself, were awe-struck
when reading <a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">Beating the
Averages</a> for the first time. While I had previous experience with
Lisp in a university setting, I was never able to crystalize my feelings
on the matter. Upon reading that essay in early 2001 I was driven to an
incredible urge to “get me some of that” – which I did by enrolling in
an Artificial Intelligence graduate school program in the fall of the
same year. I believe, based on personal conversations that there were
many who had a similar urge, but chose a different path – the path of
“halfway to Lisp”.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> That is, I believe that languages<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> like Perl, Python, and Ruby managed
to capture a significant portion of programmer mindshare because they
not only learned their lessons from Lisp, but they put many of its
powerful capabilities in the hands of their programmers.</p>
<h2 id="enter-clojure">Enter Clojure</h2>
<p>And now years later we see that Clojure, while still humble compared
to Java, C++, C, and C#, is gaining increasing popularity and mindshare
in the technological zeitgeist. In increasing cases Clojure seems to be
gaining <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/">serious
consideration for</a>, if not outright adoption. But again – why? In my
humble opinion it can be summarized as the result of a feedback loop
starting with the influence of Lisp on languages like Ruby which again
feedback into an increased interest and adoption of Clojure.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ruby.clj">ruby.clj</h2>
<p><em>I would love to hear from Ruby programmers on the following
observation<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, be it correct or
wrong-headed.</em></p>
<p>The existence of the Lisp feedback loop has lured Ruby programmers in
much the same way that Lisp lured them into Ruby in the first place.
That is, Ruby programmers being the adventurous lot to begin with, are
not satisfied with “halfway to Lisp”. Instead, they want it all. That’s
not to say that I think (nor wish) Ruby programmers will abandon ship
and run arms-wide to Clojure. Instead, I think that our industry can
support both in a complementary relationship modeled (just to name one
such scenario) much like the inner workings of <a
href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/flightcaster-clojure-rails">FlightCaster</a>.
I already see a similar path in Clojure as previously observed in Ruby<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. That is, Clojure seems to be used
in applications already built on cutting edge technologies (as noted by
Chas in his survey results post mentioned in the beginning). Is it
really too much to suppose that this environment might also appeal to
the Rubyist?</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>I’ve babbled on enough about this, but let me end by saying that I
fully expect that the inclusion of Clojure into the Well-Grounded
Rubyist’s<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> arsenal will work to strengthen said
Rubyist’s skills and indeed the language itself. Likewise, the presence
of Ruby mindshare into the Clojure community will help to motivate a
continuing culture of practicality, while also maintaining cutting edge,
yet practical, exploration.</p>
<p>Welcome Rubyists<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> – it’s a pleasure.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Guy L. Steele in a famous quote mentioned that Java
dragged C++ programmers “halfway to Lisp”. While I agree with the
sentiment in general, I always felt like Ruby and Python were sitting to
the right of the halfway mark, and Java the left.<a href="#fnref1"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I’m not implying that Paul Graham is the reason that
these languages succeeded, only that his essays may have helped provoked
similar motivations in some.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>That’s not to diminish the herculean effort by Rich
Hickey, Clojure’s author, in creating a truly beautiful language that
stands on its own merits. But if the industry has taught us anything,
it’s that the existence of superior tech does not guarantee adoption.<a
href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Thanks to some compelling conversations with <a
href="http://www.designpatternsinruby.com">Russ Olsen</a> and <a
href="http://novarug.org">Gray Herter</a> at the local Clojure meetups.
At times vodka was involved, so I hope I’m not misrepresenting their
views on the matter.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>One aspect of the Ruby community that I’ve always been
deeply impressed with is the seemingly instant birth of libraries
supporting new technologies. Clojure’s community has this to some
extent, but it’s nothing akin to the freakish rapidity displayed by
Rubyists.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"
