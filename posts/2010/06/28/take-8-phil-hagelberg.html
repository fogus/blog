<p>Continuing my series of micro-interviews with Clojure hackers I
present Technomancy (aka Phil Hagelberg). Phil continues the theme of
prolific coders having brought us a series of fantastic projects. Most
notable among his Clojure output is the (increasingly ubiquitous) <a
href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> build tool.
However, the story of his mad output does not end there as the <a
href="http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter
Kit</a>, <a
href="http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-http-client">clojure-http-client</a>,
and my personal favorite <a
href="http://github.com/technomancy/robert-hooke">Robert Hooke</a>
attest. Additionally, he is maintaining both <a
href="http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode">clojure-mode.el</a>
and <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure">Swank/Slime
for Clojure</a>. As if that were not enough, Phil is also a contributor
to the <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/duby">Duby programming
language</a> and to <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> itself –
and all of this[^slacker] is without mentioning his Ruby contributions!
Finally, Phil works for <a href="http://www.sonian.com">Sonian</a>,
which is the Avengers[^avengers] of the Clojure community.</p>

<h4>
Q: What led you to Clojure?
</h4>
<p>
I started programming with QBasic in 7th grade, and I got into writing
Zork-style text adventures. Of course I didn’t understand data
structures, so my games were very much copy/paste affairs. I wanted to
put together a tool that could create text adventures, but I ended up
trying to do this by outputting the whole source (with hard-coded rooms,
gotos, etc) to .BAS files on disk instead of separating out data and
logic. As you can imagine it didn’t work very well, but it got me
thinking.
</p>
<p>
In college I realized I’d have to make the choice at some point between
Emacs and vi. I gave them each a brief shot, but the default vi key
bindings are designed to work with a QWERTY layout and are nonsense on
Dvorak, (yes, I realize now you can fix this) so I ended up going with
Emacs. Once I got going with Elisp I realized it had the magic “programs
writing programs” property that I’d been looking for since 7th grade,
and that sealed the deal for me.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you can’t do <i>that</i> much with Elisp, at least if you
want to get paid, so I toyed around with Common Lisp. My background was
in web programming at that point, and so naturally I thought, “I know,
<a href="http://technomancy.us/1">I’ll port my blog to it!</a>” That
lasted about a month—it was so awkward at the time just to find a decent
HTTP server, so CL still has this aura of the 1980s associated with it
in my head, complete with big hair and Tears For Fears playing in the
background. (Having
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/hyperspec/HyperSpec/Body/fun_make-pathname.html">VAX
filesystem support</a> included in the language spec certainly doesn’t
help with that image.)
</p>
<p>
I got into Ruby in 2005 since it felt
“<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/06/09/clojure-rb/">close enough to
lisp</a>” to keep my interest, and the money was certainly good. But
when I watched Rich’s
<a href="http://clojure.blip.tv/file/1313398/">Clojure for Lisp
Programmers</a> videos one weekend in November of 2008 it became clear
that you could really use it for everyday tasks. So the pragmatic angle
really pulled me in, though the immutability was what caught my eye to
begin with.

<h4>
Q: Are you planning on starting a line of keyboard pants? (please say
yes)
</h4>
<p>
I’ll probably sell a kit,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair-style</a> and
let hackers put them together themselves. I wouldn’t want to deprive
them of the hands-on fun of assembly. I think they’re great, but I fully
acknowledge that I’m on the lunatic fringe of input and interface
mechanisms.
</p>
<h4>
Q: As someone who seems to manage an astonishing number of projects
simultaneously, how do you manage to avoid starving any given project?
</h4>
<p>
At first I misread this as “how do you manage to avoid <i>starting</i>
any given project”. My answer for that is more interesting, so I’ll
start there.
</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_%281825-1905%29_-_The_Remorse_of_Orestes_%281862%29.jpg/200px-William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_%281825-1905%29_-_The_Remorse_of_Orestes_%281862%29.jpg" alt="Orestes"
     align="right"  style="margin: 4px;"/></p>
<p>
It used to be that I was limited by coming up with names; naming
projects is really hard. But these days I’ve decided on a policy of
naming all my projects after literary characters, which has led me to
the opposite problem—I need to make sure my projects are good enough for
the names I’ve got in mind. I’ve got this
<a href="http://p.hagelb.org/coverage.clj.html">silly 25-line test
coverage hack</a> that I want to release, but calling it “Orestes” seems
like it doesn’t do
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oresteia">Æschylus’s work</a>
justice. So I’m limited by the rate at which I read new fiction—I need
to stumble across some minor characters with names that do a better job
at reflecting my humbler hacks.
</p>
<p>
As for avoiding <i>starving</i> any given project—well, just ask anyone
who’s sent me patches: I simply don’t. It’s disgraceful. I really try to
focus on one project at a time, but that means patches can wait for
three months before getting applied if they’re for a project I’m not
focusing on.
</p>
<p>
I try to improve this situation by giving more people commit access so I
don’t become a bottleneck, but this is tricky. I guess people don’t feel
like they’re qualified, which is totally bogus. I’m certainly not
“qualified” to maintain Swank Clojure. I got into it because of my
background in Emacs, but it turns out you really need to understand its
Common Lisp background. I have only a superficial understanding of the
codebase.
</p>
<p>
I like to think of myself more as the “steward” of that code rather than
the “maintainer”. But I get the patches applied, fix a few bugs, and get
the releases pushed out. It’s something you can ease your way into, so I
encourage readers to help out with projects they’re interested in. Don’t
be intimidated.
</p>
<h4>
Q: What is your relationship to Bus Scheme?
</h4>
<p><img src="http://technomancy.us/i/bus_logos.png" align="left"
     width="250" alt="Bus Scheme logos"  style="margin: 4px;"/></p>
<p>
Well, I used to work in downtown Seattle, so I spent a lot of time on
the bus. I got a copy of <i>The Little Schemer</i> and wanted to play
around with the ideas in it, so I started
<a href="http://bus-scheme.rubyforge.org/">Bus Scheme</a> (in Ruby) with
the stipulation that all implementation must happen while riding the
bus. I had a lot of fun with that. It never got continuations or
hygienic macros, but I had the basics of the interpreter working fine
and put together a simple CL-style macro system.
</p>
<p>
I recommend it as an exercise to folks interested in the nuts and bolts
of language implementation. It’s much less work than it sounds for a
language as small as Scheme, and to people who haven’t done their own
implementation (potential employers perhaps?) it sounds really
impressive. I certainly learned a lot about parsing and lexical scope as
well.
</p>
<p>
One of these days I’ll move on to
<a href="http://technomancy.us/107">Unicycle Java</a>, but I’ve got
enough on my plate right now.
</p>
