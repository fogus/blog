<p>David Edgar Liebke is a prolific writer of <a
href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> source codes. His project <a
href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a> is a rocket-powered statistical
environment based on <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> with
beautiful visualization capabilities (and then some). David is also a
major data geek and is not afraid to talk about it on his <a
href="http://data-sorcery.org/">Data Sorcery</a> blog. As a founding
member of <a href="http://clojure.com">Clojure/core</a>, David flys
to-and-fro in the Clojure-jet fighting against the enemies of concision,
simplicity, and bad statistics. He was gracious enough to take some time
to answer a few of my questions.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/tag/take">(take…</a> is an on-going
series of micro-interviews focused on interesting Clojurians.</em></p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-genesis-of-incanter">What is the genesis of
Incanter?</h3>
<p>Incanter is the result of a project I was working on with my Ph.D
advisor before leaving grad school to pursue Clojure/core. The goal was
to develop a standalone application for building specific kinds of
statistical models that are used in the social sciences.</p>
<p>My early prototypes were built with R, which I love, but it has
limitations as a platform for building standalone applications. So I
searched for alternatives that would give me R’s interactive development
cycle, it’s core statistical and linear algebra functions, its basic
data visualization capabilities, but that would be better suited for
general-purpose application development. That’s when I found
Clojure.</p>
<p>I spent a fair amount of time using Lisp for AI programming as an
undergrad, and then had the opportunity to spend more time with it a
couple years ago learning to write automated theorem provers. I had
always loved its minimalist syntax, the emphasis on using only a few
data structures, the mind-melting awesomeness of recursion and macros,
and of course the REPL. So, I had always kept an eye out for
opportunities to return to Lisp.</p>
<p>After a few preliminary experiments with Clojure, and a couple
different Java numeric libraries, I had basic statistical and linear
algebra functionality. Then one evening I threw <a
href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> into the mix,
giving me basic data visualizations.</p>
<p>I was able to very quickly build an environment that had some of the
key features of R that I depended on the most, just by combining Clojure
with a couple Java libraries, I was hooked and have never looked
back.</p>
<p>Incanter took on a life of its own. What was once built as the
underlying framework for a specific data modeling application became a
general purpose statistical computing environment.</p>
<h3 id="are-you-a-music-while-programming-kind-of-guy">Are you a
music-while-programming kind of guy?</h3>
<p>I don’t usually listen to music when I’m working alone or remote
pairing, but I definitely like the energy it provides when I’m working
down at <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com">Relevance</a> HQ – although
with the competing musical tastes of 20 different people (not to mention
Aaron Bedra’s perverse love of mashups), it’s an eclectic mix to be
sure.</p>
<h3 id="do-programmers-stink-at-statistics">Do programmers stink at
statistics?</h3>
<p>Almost everybody stinks at statistics. However, programmers have an
edge now that programming has become an important part of statistics.
Unfortunately, they may have no choice but to become better at it
because statistics has become an important part of computer science.</p>
<h3 id="vi-emacs-or-other">Vi, Emacs, or other?</h3>
<p>Both. I started life in Emacs, switched to vi/vim because I spent a
lot of time doing system administration. I developed much of Incanter
with vim and a command line REPL, but I finally found my way back to
Emacs for Clojure development because of the power duo of Slime and <a
href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">Paredit</a>, but I still
use vim for for everything else.</p>
<h3
id="aside-from-clojure-what-programming-languages-do-you-hold-in-high-esteem">Aside
from Clojure, what programming languages do you hold in high
esteem?</h3>
<p>I love R despite, or perhaps because of, its quirks; I love the
purity of <a href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">Scheme</a>,
and I’ve always appreciated <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>,
and after spending time at Relevance with some of the best Ruby
programmers anywhere, that appreciation has grown.</p>
<h3
id="why-did-you-give-up-the-life-of-celebrity-and-riches-to-join-clojurecore">Why
did you give up the life of celebrity and riches to join
Clojure/core?</h3>
<p>I gave up a pretty awesome job, working with some of the best people
in the bioinformatics world, a great environment, and a bit of free
time. In return I get to work with some of the best Clojurists in the
world (including <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Clojure-Pragmatic-Programmers-Halloway/dp/1934356336">Stuart
Halloway</a>, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Clojure-Definitive-Guide-VanderHart/dp/1430272317">Stuart
Sierra</a>, and the man himself, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R3LG3ZBZS4GCTH">Rich
Hickey</a>). I get a front row seat to the development of one of the
most interesting programming languages around, and I get to participate
in the early stages of a growing community, full of incredibly bright
and enthusiastic people. It was an opportunity I couldn’t resist.</p>
<h3
id="can-you-provide-a-picture-summarizing-your-feelings-about-clojurecore">Can
you provide a picture summarizing your feelings about Clojure/core?</h3>
<p>I think this pretty much sums up my feelings.</p>

<h3
id="why-should-anyone-care-about-clojurecore-and-clojure-in-general">Why
should anyone care about Clojure/core and Clojure in general?</h3>
<p>Well, I think the goals of Clojure/core are pretty cool</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Help fund the further development of Clojure</li>
<li>Help improve the Clojure ecosystem and community</li>
<li>Help those that don’t understand the benefits of Clojure’s approach
to see the value</li>
<li>Help those that already understand the value to build systems</li>
</ol>
<p>And I think the combination of in-depth knowledge of the Clojure
language and Relevance’s well known expertise in agile development is
pretty fantastic.</p>
<p>I consider Lisp the first agile programming language. Later languages
couldn’t match its power and fast development cycle. Eventually features
like dynamic typing, interactive development with a REPL, and
meta-programming made their way to newer languages. In time leading to
Ruby, and now Clojure brings it back full circle.</p>
