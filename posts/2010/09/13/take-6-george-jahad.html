<p>George Jahad is, in my estimation, one of the most exciting Clojure
hackers. His public output, while spartan, is incredibly compelling.
I’ve learned<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> quite a bit from his Clojure output
and hope to see more. George works for <a
href="http://runa.com/">Runa</a> (they are <a
href="http://www.workatruna.com/">hiring</a> BTW); one of the big four<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

<h3 id="what-led-you-to-clojure">What led you to Clojure?</h3>
<p>My road to Clojure has been lined not just with great technology, but
with great people. Smart, fun-loving, dynamic people who have really
made a difference in my life. Great technology combined with great
people; it’s irresistible!</p>
<p>In early 2009, I was programming in C, porting Android to different
devices, and wanted to try something higher level. Hacking emacs was
often the funnest part of my work day. I knew I’d never get paid to do
that, so I started studying other lisps. Then going to the <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/">Bay Area
Clojure meetups</a> sponsored by the Runa guys, <a
href="http://twitter.com/amitrathore"><span class="citation"
data-cites="amitrathore">@amitrathore</span></a>, and <a
href="http://twitter.com/rberger"><span class="citation"
data-cites="rberger">@rberger</span></a>. (They’ve been doing a great
job of promoting Clojure in the SF Bay Area; I wouldn’t be a
professional Clojure programmer today if it weren’t for them.)</p>
<p>I was an anti-java snob, so it took a while, but I kept going to
meetups and following the <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure">mailing list</a>; pretty
soon, I realized I’d found something special.</p>
<p>I started getting involved: added <a
href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/cljdb.html">Clojure support to the
Emacs JDB interface</a>, and got the <a
href="http://is.gd/eA1El">Clojure REPL working on Android</a>.</p>
<p>Amit encouraged me to show my stuff at <a
href="http://www.mefeedia.com/watch/20002628">a meetup with Rich</a>. We
all went out to dinner afterwards. I was disappointed not to get to sit
at Rich’s table. Instead I sat next to a couple of characters named <a
href="http://twitter.com/dysinger"><span class="citation"
data-cites="dysinger">@dysinger</span></a> and <a
href="http://twitter.com/technomancy"><span class="citation"
data-cites="technomancy">@technomancy</span></a><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
I’d never heard of them before! A few months later, Tim hired me to do
Clojure full time at Sonian. Missing dinner with Rich ended up being one
of the best things that ever happened to me!</p>
<p>I received my “phd” in Clojure at the University of Sonian. My
professors were Doctors Dysinger, Hagelberg, <a
href="http://github.com/danlarkin">Larkin</a> and <a
href="http://github.com/scgilardi">Gilardi</a>. My dissertation was the
<a href="http://github.com/GeorgeJahad/debug-repl">debug-repl</a>. Given
the level of ability there, I wanted to show I was “worthy”; I was also
growing annoyed by Clojure’s lack of debugging tools. Unfortunately, the
original version required hacking the compiler. Thankfully, <a
href="atosborne"><span class="citation"
data-cites="atosborne">@atosborne</span></a> showed that unnecessary,
that an existing Compiler var would suffice, and the debug-repl was
born. Then <a href="http://twitter.com/hugoduncan"><span
class="citation" data-cites="hugoduncan">@hugoduncan</span></a> ported
it to Slime and you and <a
href="http://blog.n01se.net/?author=3">Chris</a> discussed it in the <a
href="http://joyofclojure.com">JoC</a>; Rich sanctified the whole thing
by <a
href="http://github.com/GeorgeJahad/debug-repl/commit/1f4381ed5f8dd40b5111f91e94f5cedef96ac1ac">exposing
the Compiler var as the implicit <code>&amp;env</code> arg to
macros</a>.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/stuartsierra"><span
class="citation" data-cites="stuartsierra">@stuartsierra</span></a>
won’t be happy with my answer, but it’s: <a

<p>The audacity of bending Clojure to your will with 12 lines of
code.</p>
<p><a href="http://stuartsierra.com/">Stuart</a>, the author, hates it
because he says it’s too buggy and breaks on too many edge cases, but
it’s been really good to me. I’ve used it to solve a number of problems,
including how to <a
href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/difform.html">diff two clojure
forms</a>.</p>
<p>If Stuart has the time, I’d be interested in hearing more about the
problems. I haven’t run into them yet.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-describe-your-typical-day-at-runa">Can you describe your
typical day at Runa?</h3>
<p>I stayed in touch with Amit and Rob, and as I learned more about the
work, I got real excited about what they were doing. Basically, the Runa
guys have found gross inefficiencies in the e-commerce systems that
exist today and are using Clojure to ameliorate them. The inefficiencies
are so great, that we only have to make a small difference to have a big
impact on our customers’ bottom line.</p>
<p>In a typical day, I will explore any problems that have occurred in
the runtime in the last 24 hours; if there is nothing serious there,
then I think about ways to make the system more efficient or easier to
maintain/debug or continue adding features. It’s a totally new business
model. We’re figuring it out as we go, trying new things each day to see
what sticks. <em>That’s another reason why Clojure is such a good fit
for us. We need to be able to make significant changes to a large system
on a daily basis, without the whole thing falling apart.</em></p>
<p>When things get tense, we have a “meeting”, Amit’s euphemism for
playing Quake3.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s a very smart, collegial environment, with a strict <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UacbJ72dluU&amp;feature=channel">no
a**holes policy</a>, aggressively attacking interesting problems with
Clojure.</p>

<p>The debug-repl is pretty good overall, but has a few weaknesses, due
to the nature of Clojure. The main ones are that it can’t be invoked
automatically when an exception is thrown, and it can’t show the local
scope from higher up in the stack. Fixing that would require changing
Clojure internals. Rich has suggested, and I agree, that before we spend
a lot of time changing Clojure to improving debugging, we should be
exploiting the debug infrastructure the Java vm already provides.</p>
<p>I started doing this with a <a
href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/cdt.html">Clojure Debugging
Toolkit</a>. It’s a command line debugger, like JDB or GDB, but the
command line is the standard Clojure REPL, with extensions that allow
you to set breakpoints on function entry or exceptions, and eval clojure
expressions on the remote target.</p>
<p>While it’s already functional, it’s missing some standard features
like: stepping, modification of locals, breakpoints on line numbers.
After adding those, I’ll extend cljdb as an Emacs based front end.</p>
<p>There is also a problem with the compiler clearing locals; it’s great
when you are trying to avoid holding the head of a lazy seq, but not so
good when you are debugging and trying to look up the stack to see what
the values are there. Hopefully, that will be addressable somehow.</p>
<p>Once those basics are done, we can start doing some interesting
things. Start’s thinking about it as a DSL for the creation of debugging
features. For example, it should be fairly easy to create a seq of all
the local vars in all the stack frames in all the threads on the VM. You
could then filter that looking for ones that might be holding the
head.</p>

<p>I’m a total Emacs geek. Use it for all of the above as well as
shells, debuggers, bookmarks, window management, email, IRC and
text-based web browsing. Regularly have 400 buffers<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
open in a single session. Emacs is to editors what Clojure is to
languages.</p>
<p>Before I go, I just wanted to say I’m really looking forward to <a
href="http://first.clojure-conj.org/">clojure-conj in October</a>.
Thanks loads to the <a href="http://clojure.com">Clojure/core</a> team
for pulling it together. It’s going to be awesome! See you all
there![^drink]</p>
