<p><a href="http://github.com/fogus/skiing">Combinators are fun</a>. In
fact, there seems to be a combinator renaissance lately – almost like
the Ancient Greeks who excavated Mycenaean technology surpassing their
own<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. There is one specific combinator
called the <em>Thrush</em> that <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2009/09/04/understanding-the-clojure-macro/">effectively
takes a set of nested functions and turns them into a pipeline</a>.
There are far better explanations of the Thrush than this, including <a
href="http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2008-10-30/thrush.markdown#readme">one
by Reginald Braithwaite focusing on Ruby</a>, <a
href="http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2010/04/thrush-in-clojure.html">one
by Debasish Ghosh focusing on Clojure</a>, and <a
href="http://clojure.bighugh.com/thrush.html">and another focused on
Clojure by Shawn Hoover</a>. Go ahead and read those – I’ll wait…</p>
<p>Of the posts linked above, I tend to point people toward Reginald
Braithwaite’s treatment because it focuses in on the functional aspects
whereas the latter two do not. What do I mean by that? Well, the Clojure
treatments focus too much on the <code>-&gt;</code> and
<code>-&gt;&gt;</code> macros which are only <em>mostly</em> Thrush
combinators. What a wishy-washy thing to say! Maybe a more direct way to
phrase it is that neither <code>-&gt;</code> nor <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>
are the Thrush combinator. Eeeek!</p>
<h2 id="a-little-bit-about-macros">A Little Bit About Macros</h2>
<p>Macros in Clojure (and Lisp in general) operate in different “times”,
the most obvious being “compilation time”. The picture is actually
foggier than this, but for this discussion it should suffice. What that
means is that a macro receives its arguments as unevaluated data
structures that are then manipulated in some way before being fed into
the compiler. In the case of the <code>-&gt;</code> macro, a call of the
following will look and act just like the Thrush operator mentioned in
the posts above:</p>
<pre><code>(-&gt; 5 (+ 4) -)
;=&gt; -9</code></pre>
<p>That is, we take the number 5, feed it into the addition (to four)
function, and then negate it. The expansion of this macro call would
be:</p>
<pre><code>(- (+ 5 4))
;=&gt; -9</code></pre>
<p>This is what I meant by <em>mostly Thrush</em>.</p>
<p>However, <code>-&gt;</code> performs a transformation of its
arguments into a nested form and doesn’t deal directly with functions at
all, if it did then we would expect the following to work:</p>
<pre><code>(-&gt; 5 (fn [x] (+ x 4)) -)
; java.lang.RuntimeException: 
;   java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException...</code></pre>
<p>The reason for this exception can be understood by observing the
following:</p>
<pre><code>(macroexpand-1 &#39;(-&gt; 5 (fn [x] (+ x 4))))
;=&gt; (fn 5 [x] (+ x 4))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-&gt;</code> macro is treating the form
<code>(fn [x] (+ x 4))</code> not as a function at all but instead as a
list of the symbol <code>fn</code>, a vector <code>[x]</code>, and
another list <code>(+ x 4)</code> and just plops <code>5</code> right
between the the symbol and vector. Clearly <code>-&gt;</code> is not the
Thrush at all, but does play one on TV.</p>
<h2 id="the-thrush-in-clojure">The Thrush in Clojure</h2>
<p>Clojure has a function <code>comp</code> that works similarly to how
we want the Thrush to act, but it does so in reverse – so why not fix
that “deficiency” directly:</p>
<pre><code>(defn thrush [a &amp; args] 
  ((apply comp (reverse args)) a))

(thrush 5 (fn [x] (+ x 4)) -)
;=&gt; -9</code></pre>
<p>Hooray!! We’ve done it! A real-live Thrush combinator in Clojure.
There is one problem however. This implementation is forced to walk the
arguments once more than it should. A more elegant and efficient
solution (by <a href="http://blog.n01se.net">Chris Houser</a>, author of
<a href="http://joyofclojure.com">The Joy of Clojure</a>) is as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>(defn thrush [&amp; args] 
  (reduce #(%2 %1) args))

(thrush 5 #(+ % 4) -)
;=&gt; -9</code></pre>
<p>Elegant indeed!</p>
<h2 id="thrushiness">Thrushiness</h2>
<p>My goal in this post was not to bash the view of <code>-&gt;</code>
and <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> as having a high degree of Thrushiness.
Instead, I wanted to illustrate that they are not entirely Thrushful,
and you can run into issues if you treat them as such.</p>
