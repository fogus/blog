<p><a href="http://github.com/Raynes">Raynes</a> (<em>aka</em> Anthony
Grimes) is a Clojure prodigy. His projects have gained some notoriety in
the community, but chief among them is <a
href="http://try-clojure.org">Try Clojure</a>. Following in the
footsteps of other <strong>Try XX</strong> sites, Anthony is gradually
pulling together what will, in my opinion, prove to be an invaluable
asset for Clojure neophytes.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/tag/take">(take…</a> is an on-going
series of micro-interviews focused on interesting Clojurians.</em></p>
<h3 id="what-led-you-to-clojure">What led you to Clojure?</h3>
<p>My first <em>real</em> language was actually Haskell. When I started
programming, I found little more than frustration in object oriented
languages like C#. Everything felt so unnecessarily complex to me.
Classes for every little thing, OOP here, there, and everywhere.</p>
<p>A friend introduced me to Haskell, and that’s when I really started
to learn to program rather than swim around in bulky OOP concepts that
made little sense to me.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve played with all sorts of languages. Ruby, Scala,
Ioke, Factor, etc. On the JVM, Scala lead me to Clojure. Finding Clojure
was like seeing God. Clojure is everything I’ve ever wanted. All the
good of OOP without any of the bad, bulky, and complex. I’ve been using
Clojure for probably around a year, but I’ve been playing with it for
probably two. All together, I’ve been programming a little over 3 years,
and at the time of this writing, I’m 16 years old.</p>
<h3
id="youve-been-finding-some-nice-niches-with-your-clojure-projects.-are-you-specifically-targetting-specific-niches-or-has-it-simply-fallen-that-way">You’ve
been finding some nice niches with your Clojure projects. Are you
specifically targetting specific niches, or has it simply fallen that
way?</h3>
<p>My projects are random at best. sexpbot started as a little script to
connect to IRC with <a
href="http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php">Pircbot</a>. It turned into my
largest project, and managed to spin off another project, Irclj, an IRC
library I wrote to replace Pircbot in sexpbot.</p>
<p>As for try-clojure, I don’t remember exactly how that was started,
but I made a joke about the other TryLanguage sites to my buddy <a
href="http://blog.licenser.net">Heinz</a> (Licenser) in #clojure-casual
on freenode, and how we should write one for Clojure. I never intended
to actually do it, but by the next day, Heinz had already bought the
domain and decided it would be. I’m happy he did. It’s my first real
well-known (kind of) project, and despite my horrible design skills, I’m
quite proud of it. :)</p>
<h3 id="can-you-share-your-favorite-code-snippet">Can you share your
favorite code snippet?</h3>
<p>Probably going to have to be this one:</p>
<pre><code>require&#39;socket&#39; 
a,p,c=$*
$&gt;=TCPSocket.new a,p
puts&quot;USER &quot;*5,&quot;NICK w&quot;
$&gt;.each{|l|puts case l
when/(P.+)-/
$1+$&#39;
when/PI/
&quot;PO#$&#39;JOIN &quot;+c
end}</code></pre>
<p>from <a
href="http://scott-olson.org/2010/05/16/the-ruby-irc-bot-that-fits-in-a-tweet.html">here</a></p>
<p>Scott is a friend, and that snippet is pretty impressive. It’s all
that comes to mind right now.</p>
<h3 id="zombiesz-or-vampires"><a
href="http://www.quora.com/Why-do-zombies-terrify-us-so">Zombies</a> or
vampires?</h3>
<p>Vampires, of course. Zombies just walk<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
around stupidly. Vampires are lucid and strong.</p>
<h3 id="whats-your-next-project">What’s your next project?</h3>
<p>I don’t have any real plans right now, but my next new project will
probably be a graphical RSS and Atom reader. Something I’ve been wanting
to do for a while. It will be two projects when it happens. A library
for reading the feeds, and the actual application. I want the RSS
reading stuff to be a library itself so that I can use it in
sexpbot.</p>
<p>Mostly, I just need to do some serious work on existing stuff like
sexpbot and tryclojure. sexpbot is one of those
never-going-to-be-finished projects.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-listen-to-when-you-code">What do you listen to when
you code?</h3>
<p>Pretty much everything I have. Most recently, The Script, AC/DC, and
The All-American Rejects. Other ones include Adam Lambert, Shinedown,
Train, Disturbed, and lots of Coldplay.</p>
