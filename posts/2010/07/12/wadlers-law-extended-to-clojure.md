Philip Wadler is a PLT thinker of the highest order.  In addition to the mind-boggling insights into the art of programming, his cutting wit[^wit] is second to none.  In late 1996 he unveiled "Wadler's law", described[^rev] as:

> In any language design, the total time spent discussing a feature in this list is 
> proportional to two raised to the power of its position.

Every language is affected[^csyn] by Wadler's Law and Clojure is no different.  Therefore, I humbly present[^lisp] the following:

    0. Clojure semantics
    1. Prefix notation
    2. The positioning of parenthesis
    3. The elimination of parenthesis

[^csyn]: Although most follow the original four points.

[^rev]: Revised from an earlier version proposed in 1992.  More information can be found at <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Wadlers_Law>

[^wit]: Very often I've found that Haskellers have the most acute sense of humor.  I wonder if it's Haskell that attracts this type or if it creates them.

[^lisp]: This list could probably apply to most Lisp-derived languages.
