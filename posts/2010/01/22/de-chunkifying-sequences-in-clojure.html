<p><em>note: code modified to work with Clojure v1.2 on 2010.Nov.27
thanks to a reminder by <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/colin">Colin
Jones</a></em></p>
<p>At the first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cap-Clug/">CAP CLUG</a>
meetup I gave a <a
href="http://www.fogus.me/static/preso/clj1.1+">presentation about the
features of the recent Clojure 1.1</a> and one of the topics that
garnered interest was that of chunked sequences. For those of you not
familiar with chunked sequences they can be summarized fairly easily.
Clojure <a href="http://clojure.org/sequences">sequence</a> functions
are lazy, however with the release of Clojure 1.1 the granularity of
this laziness was changed from a 1-at-a-time to a chunk-at-a-time model.
In other words, instead of “walking” through a sequence one node at a
time, chunked sequences provide a “windowed” viewed on sequences
32-elements wide. We can see this in action with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>(def gimme #(do (print \.) %))

(take 1 (map gimme (range 32)))</code></pre>
<p>We might expect that this little snippet would print
<code>(.0)</code> because we’re only grabbing the first element, and if
you’re running Clojure 1.0 that is exactly what you would see. However,
in Clojure 1.1 the picture is a bit different:</p>
<pre><code>;=&gt; (................................0)</code></pre>
<p>If you count the dots you’ll see exactly 32, which is what we would
expect given my statement from the first paragraph. Expanding a bit
further if we increase the argument to <code>range</code> to be 33
instead what do you expect we’d then see?</p>
<pre><code>(take 1 (map gimme (range 33)))
;=&gt; (................................0)</code></pre>
<p>Yep, that’s 32 dots again. To move our chunky window to the right is
as simple as asking for its first element by:</p>
<pre><code>(take 1 (drop 32 (map gimme (range 64))))
;=&gt; (................................................................32)</code></pre>
<p>You be might starting to wonder about this. In fact, you might be
worried that chunked sequences have squashed the entire point of lazy
sequences and for small sequences you would be correct. However, the
benefits of lazy sequences are really striking for those of cyclopean
magnitudes – I’m talking larger than memory big. Chunked sequences in
those cases in those cases are an incredible boon because not only do
they make sequence functions more efficient overall, they still fulfill
the promise of lazy sequences: <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/afyav/clojure_11_rc1_out_cuts_some_overhead_of/c0headd">avoiding
full realization of interim results</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are legitimate concerns about this chunked model and
one such concern is that of desiring a 1-at-a-time model to avoid
exploding computations. Without going into too much detail about that, a
nice straw-man to use as a counterpoint against chunked sequences is
that of building an infinite sequence of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Primes">Mersenne primes</a>.
That is, implicit realization of the first 32 Mersenne primes through
chunked sequences will be quite costly indeed.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to combat such situations I present a simple
function (useable only in the current “new” branch) to de-chunkify a
lazy sequence and enforce the 1-at-a-time model:</p>
<pre><code>(defn seq1 [#^clojure.lang.ISeq s]
  (reify clojure.lang.ISeq
    (first [_] (.first s))
    (more [_] (seq1 (.more s)))
    (next [_] (let [sn (.next s)] (and sn (seq1 sn))))
    (seq [_] (let [ss (.seq s)] (and ss (seq1 ss))))
    (count [_] (.count s))
    (cons [_ o] (.cons s o))
    (empty [_] (.empty s))
    (equiv [_ o] (.equiv s o))))

(take 1 (map gimme (seq1 (range 32))))
;=&gt; (.0)

(take 1 (drop 32 (map gimme (seq1 (range 64)))))
;=&gt; (.................................32)</code></pre>
<p>And there you go! Now you can again safely generate your lazy,
infinite sequence of Mersenne primes! The world rejoices.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, that the code for <code>seq1</code> is in <strong>no
way official</strong> and should not be used for production code.
Clojure will one day provide an official version of the function above,
but for now I simply took a <a
href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/90536">rough sketch</a> posted by
Rich Hickey and made it work with the “master” branch as an exercise and
to hopefully gain more insight into the whole matter of chunkiness in
general. Hopefully, it can serve the same purposes for you.</p>
<p>-m</p>
<p>p.s. I’m <a href="http://joyofclojure.com">writing a book about
Clojure</a> with <a href="http://blog.n01se.net">Chris Houser</a>. The
matter of chunked sequences and many other Clojure topics will be
covered. ^_^</p>
