<p><a href="http://formpluslogic.blogspot.com/">Brenton Ashworth</a> is
relatively new to the Clojure community, but has already created four
interesting (and useful) projects: <a
href="http://github.com/brentonashworth/deview">deview</a>, <a
href="http://github.com/brentonashworth/lein-difftest">lein-difftest</a>,
<a href="http://github.com/brentonashworth/sandbar">sandbar</a> and <a
href="http://github.com/brentonashworth/carte">carte</a>. I met Brenton
at the previous <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/clojure/">Pragmatic
Clojure Studio</a> and we talked a little bit about what would
eventually become carte. He’s an interesting guy with interesting
ideas.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/tag/take">(take…</a> is an on-going
series of micro-interviews focused on Clojure.</em></p>
<h3 id="what-led-you-to-clojure">What led you to Clojure?</h3>
<p>I was looking for a language that was good for writing concurrent
programs. The options were <a
href="http://www.erlang.org/index.html">Erlang</a>, <a
href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/242">Scala</a> and Clojure; which I
evaluated in that order. This order came about naturally from the order
in which I could obtain books on each of these languages. It was mid
2008, “<a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang">Programming
Erlang</a>” was already out, “<a
href="www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala">Programming in
Scala</a>” came out in November of 2008 and then “<a
href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming
Clojure</a>” in May 2009. After my initial evaluation, I liked all three
languages (still do), but I was most impressed with Scala. Erlang seemed
more like a specialized language for distributed, fault-tolerant
programming but not necessarily a great general purpose language.
Clojure was the most foreign and the one which I liked least. I wrote a
couple of small programs in both Scala and Clojure for comparison. The
Scala versions were easier to write and more readable.</p>
<p>At about this time, I started watching and re-watching some of <a
href="http://clojure.blip.tv/">Rich’s presentations on Clojure</a>. I
loved all of the ideas behind the language: functional programming,
identity separated from value, persistent data structures, etc… I also
knew from experience that OO is overused. I just didn’t like actually
writing Clojure code. I suddenly realized that Clojure wasn’t the
problem, I was. I didn’t like Clojure because the syntax was foreign and
it was hard to think non-imperatively. So, I decided to force myself to
use it until I liked it. If it wasn’t for those presentations by Rich,<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I would have never made that
decision.</p>
<p>After a year of Clojure programming, it is much easier to read
Clojure code than it is to read Java or C++. Consequently, I read a lot
more code these days. I’m now convinced that choosing a language based
on how easy it is to read or write is a very bad idea. What if we chose
musical instruments based on how easy they are to play? Everyone would
playing kazoos. You can’t think deeply about music if all you know is a
kazoo. Skill at reading and writing code is learned. We should choose
languages based on how accurately they allow us to think about the
problems we are trying to solve.</p>
<h3

part of the Clojure Studio did you find the most compelling?</h3>
<p>Whenever I listen to Rich speak about Clojure, I am always impressed
by how he uses <a
href="http://wiki.jvmlangsummit.com/Clojure_Keynote">ideas from science,
philosophy or real world examples</a> to justify or explain decisions he
has made about the language. This is the one aspect that I like most
about Clojure; the ideas in Clojure are more in sync with the real world
than any other language I am aware of. It is easy for us as developers
to let crazy ideas get into our software and these usually cause us
problems. At one point in the Studio, when Rich was talking about maps
being functions of their keys and keywords being functions of maps
someone asked, “Why not make lists functions of their indexes?”. I
remember thinking, “that’s interesting”. Rich’s response was, “Lists are
not functions, as an idea.”. At another point when Rich was talking
about how readers don’t block, someone suggested that it would be nice
if you could see the current value of something. Rich’s response: “There
is not such thing as the current value. The future just keeps coming.”.
Rich’s commitment to ensuring that Clojure has a strong connection to
reality is mind-blowing.</p>

aspect of Clojure did/do you find the most difficult to grasp?</h3>
<p><a href="http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs</a>.
Just kidding.</p>
<p>It is hard to leave behind imperative thinking. I still find myself
writing ugly code and then realizing that it is ugly because it is
overly imperative. Once I realize this and re-write it using functional
techniques, it is much smaller and all of the difficulties disappear. It
is hard to get to the point where my first thought is the correct
functional version.</p>
<p>This is one big advantage of Clojure over Scala. In Scala, imperative
code doesn’t stand out<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> as being out-of-place and ugly.
Coming from Java, it would take much longer to learn functional
programming in Scala than it does in Clojure.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next-for-you-and-clojure">What’s next for you and
Clojure?</h3>
<p>Recently, I have been working on Deview which currently provides a
more dynamic view of running tests and displays better test results with
diffs, when tests fail, as well as shorter stacktraces. This is just the
beginning. Very soon it will run all tests automatically when files are
modified, run only the tests that need to be run based on which files
were modified and run tests in parallel. The theme here is to shorten
the amount of time between when you break something and when you know
exactly what the problem is. If this period of time is too large then
you lose your train of thought. To finish out testing, I will add some
kind of test coverage reporting.</p>
<p>Because Clojure code is just data, it will be relatively easy to turn
this tool into something that can analyze that data and make suggestions
for improvements. It will report things like functions without doc
strings, suggestions for cleaning up namespace declarations, and
occasions where another function might be better than the one you are
using (e.g. <code>(not (= x))</code> -&gt; <code>(not= x)</code>).</p>
<p>For every one idea I implement, I get ten more; so, we will see how
far I get.</p>
<p>I am also obsessed with the idea of graphical representations of
Clojure data structures and therefore Clojure code. I may play around
with the idea of creating images of Clojure at various levels of
abstraction. It would be nice to a have function that creates an image
of the namespace dependencies for a project or the flow of code from a
specific function. This would become a part of Deview and also could be
a great addition to automatically generated documentation.</p>
