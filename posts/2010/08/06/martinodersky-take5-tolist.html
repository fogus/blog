<p>Dr. Martin Odersky, the lead designer/developer of the <a
href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala Programming Language</a>, Generic
Java, and Pizza requires no introduction, but the motivation for this
micro-interview does. That is, there is an unfortunate view in some
circles that sees the existence of Scala and Clojure as somehow being at
odds. In chatting with Dr. Odersky it is my hope to dispel the notion
that there is a need for ill-will. I would like to quote Brenton
Ashworth, as he sets the tone nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should choose languages based on how accurately they allow us to
think about the problems we are trying to solve. – <a
href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/08/03/take-5-brenton-ashworth/">Brenton
Ashworth</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only is the mutual existence of Scala and Clojure important, it
is indeed absolutely vital. As it happens, Clojure more closely fits the
shape of my own thoughts and ways of working, but Scala serves as muse
for a great minds like <a href="http://www.codecommit.com/blog/">Daniel
Spiewak</a> and <a href="http://jonasboner.com/">Jonas Bonér</a>. I
could continue along this train of thought, but I think that Dr. Odersky
makes a better point than I could.</p>
<h3 id="in-order-for-scala-to-win-does-clojure-need-to-lose">In order
for Scala to “win”, does Clojure need to “lose”?</h3>
<p>No, this is silly. Let’s be realistic. Functional programming is
still <a
href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">far
from being mainstream</a>. A lot of hard work is needed to get it there.
And infighting will just damage the adoption of functional programming
as a whole. By contrast, any win of a functional language in an
enterprise raises the credibility of all other functional languages.

<h3 id="what-are-your-thoughts-about-clojure">What are your thoughts
about Clojure?</h3>
<p>I have not programmed in Clojure. From what I can see it is a very
well put together language, that brings the power of Lisp to the JVM in
a practical package. There are things we liked so much in Clojure that
we copied<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> them, for instance the data
structures for sequences and <a
href="https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/1509">hash-tries</a>. I
believe there are, and will be, many other areas of fruitful
cross-pollination<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"

<p>Erlang was the template after which <a
href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/242">Scala’s actor’s library</a>
was modeled and it might have influenced Clojure’s agents as well. Lisp,
Scheme and Prolog had some indirect influences to Scala. But the tricky
part of any language design in Scala is really getting the static types
right, so in that sense Haskell, SML, OCaml and F# had a stronger
influence. Then of course there’s Java which as the primary host
language influences what’s possible in Scala and Clojure to no small
degree.</p>

Hickey is as well-read in the academic papers as anyone, but it’s Scala
that has gained the perception as an “academic language”. Why do you
think that has happened?</h2>
<p>I think it’s mostly people who want to put Scala down making that
comment. They take my <a
href="http://www.epfl.ch/index.fr.html">EPFL</a> affiliation and the
papers<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> we publish as an excuse to attach
that label to the language. What’s funny is that often senior industrial
Scala programmers get also accused as being academic. All this is rather
ironical because Scala is foremost an industrial language<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
with many well known companies using it. By contrast it’s much less
taught at universities than Haskell or Lisp, let alone Java!</p>

found many Scala and Haskell programmers who posses an extremely acute
sense of humor. Is it static typing that attracts these minds, or does
it create them?</h2>
<p>Maybe it’s the creative pauses forced on them when they wait for the
type-checker to finish ;-)</p>
