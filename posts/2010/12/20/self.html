<p>I’ve been an object-oriented practitioner for years and like many
others I’ve come to find it wanting. To be fair, while I think there are
valid complaints against OOP in general, the more egregious failings
tend to be matters of implementation. For example, in any discussion
involving Java’s OOP, the faults of Java’s implementation tends to
falsely serve as a proxy for the overall failings of object-orientation
proper. It’s almost as if Java’s specific implementation can serve as
the template for a more general discussion point. I guess this is how
humans operate – someone should figure out how to harness that for
good.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the <a
href="http://labs.oracle.com/self/language.html">Self programming
language</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve never heard of Self? Shame on you for sure, but your
saving grace is that you’ve likely heard of<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> or
used a least one of: Javascript, <a
href="http://iolanguage.com/">Io</a>, <a
href="http://ioke.org/">Ioke</a>, <a
href="http://waltersmith.us/newton">NewtonScript</a>, <a
href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, or <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/www/cecil.html">Cecil</a>
and I guarantee that the creators of these language
<strong>have</strong>. To put it as succinctly as possible: Self is the
quintessential prototype-based programming language and forms the nexus
of influence for every other similar language.</p>
<p>I was initially introduced to the idea of prototypal inheritance when
reading Douglas Crockford’s <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0596517742?tag=fogus-20">Javascript:
The Good Parts</a>. You see, I had been using Javascript on and off (as
needed) for a long time prior to reading that book, but like many fools
who use Javascript I chose to shoe-horn my notion of “good
object-oriented principles” into the language. Much to my dismay,
Javascript let me do it. Further to my dismay, <a
href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html">Mr. Crockford
taught me how to do it</a>. But I don’t blame Crockford for my missing
the point – the fault was entirely my own. Javascript is a very powerful
programming language for many reasons that have nothing to do with
object-oriented programming. Instead, the point to be derived from
Crockford’s essay is not to implement classical inheritance and stop
there under the assumption that you’ve reached the pinnacle of domain
modeling. Instead, we should explore how far we can push Javascript’s
inherent power to express our solutions in different ways. Alas, it’s
always fun to mold a powerful programming language to operate under
different guiding principles than its own, even if those principles
happen to be less powerful.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Which leads me back to the <a href="http://selflanguage.org/">Self
programming language</a>.</p>
<p>You see, while Crockford gave me hint of the power potential for
prototype-based languages, it wasn’t until I read <em>Organizing
Programs without Classes</em> by David Ungar, Craig Chambers, Bay-Wei
Chang, and Urs Hölzle that I really became excited. I’m a sucker for
under-appreciated programming paradigms and techniques, so the ideal of
the prototype was immediately appealing. But as I read, hacked, and
explored further I’ve come to realize that there is much more potential
to prototypes than I could have ever imagined. More amazingly, if you
take some time to explore the excellent <a
href="http://selflanguage.org/documentation/published/index.html">Self
bibliography</a> you might notice that its influence runs much deeper
than just prototype-based techniques. In fact, you can explore how its
implementation of <a
href="http://selflanguage.org/documentation/published/pics.html">polymorphic
inline caches</a> has driven much in <a
href="https://groups.google.com/group/strongtalk-general/browse_frm/thread/15a0d0da2d8ea773/d1688526916e3324?hl=ky&amp;#d1688526916e3324">the
way that Javascript engines are implemented</a><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
these days. The <a href="https://github.com/russellallen/self">canonical
implementation of Self can be found on Github</a>, and in the coming
months I plan to tear it apart to see how it ticks.</p>
