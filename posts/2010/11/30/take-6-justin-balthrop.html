<h3 id="what-led-you-to-clojure">What led you to Clojure?</h3>
<p>I was obsessed with Logo in fourth grade. The other kids wanted to
play Oregon Trail, and I wanted to tell the turtle how to draw things.
The fact that the drawing commands were relative to the turtle’s current
position made a lot of sense to me. It’s so different from the way a
human draws. Like the difference between looking at a maze on paper and
actually being inside a maze.</p>
<p>After that, I didn’t see Lisp again until my second year in college.
I almost gave up on Computer Science after the first C++ class, but
someone in one of my math classes convinced me to take “Non-Imperative
Programming”. It was all about Scheme, and I was obsessed immediately.
The professor, <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~williams">Lance
Williams</a>, taught the class using Emacs instead of a chalk board. He
wrote programs and ran them in class, debugging and refactoring as he
went. There was something magical about the REPL and the way it let you
develop software. I think I was more comfortable in Scheme after one day
than C++ after an entire semester.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t have another functional programming class for two
years, I applied to be a teaching assistant for the Scheme class so I
could keep doing it. There’s nothing better than the look on a person’s
face when functional programming starts making sense to them. After
that, I started reading <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp">SICP</a>
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0133708756?tag=fogus-20">ANSI
Common Lisp</a>. Paul Graham’s philosophy of <a
href="http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html">building programs from the
bottom up</a> quickly overtook the UML diagrams and requirements
documents of traditional software engineering in my head.</p>
<p>Over the next eight years, I ended up doing C++, a bit of Java, then
Perl and Ruby. I didn’t think I could make money programming Lisp, so I
settled on Ruby, appeasing myself with the block syntax instead of
macros and making my coworkers uncomfortable with too many lambdas. I
tried to write functional Ruby code, but it was always a struggle. I
once had to change a purely functional library to be impure because the
calls to clone were too expensive without persistent data structures. It
seemed like a small trade-off for performance at the time, but using
mutable data structures allowed a bunch of nasty bugs to creep in since
then. Someone should volunteer to implement persistent data structures
for Ruby as a community service…</p>
<p>In the end, I happened upon Clojure by accident. We were in the
process of looking for a faster language than Ruby for our graph
traversal algorithms at Geni. We’d narrowed the choice down to Java, C++
or Erlang, when I saw a forum post comparing Clojure to Erlang that
claimed Clojure could be as fast as Java with the right optimizations. I
built a prototype of our graph in Clojure that was 10-20 times faster
than our Ruby version, and I’ve been doing Clojure full-time ever
since.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-cake-and-why-is-it-important">What is Cake and why is it
important?</h3>
<p>Cake is the build tool that we didn’t mean to write. We spent a
heroic amount of time trying to use existing tools, but in the end, it
came down to two things: 1) we wanted to write our builds in Clojure,
not XML and 2) our builds were too complicated to do in <a
href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a>. This was
before lein had hooks, and the first version of Cake was actually a
proof of concept I wrote to show how I thought hooks should work in
Leiningen. Then <a href="http://twitter.com/lancepantz">Lance
Bradley</a> added some basic tasks and all of a sudden we had a build
tool.</p>
<p>I was pretty smitten by Martin Fowler’s <a
href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html">rake article</a> when
I started programming Ruby, and it convinced me that dependency-based
programming was the way to go for a build tool. Don’t get me wrong,
functions are great. All but the most simple tasks in Cake are written
as functions internally. But when you’re dealing with a bunch of
interconnected actions that by definition have side-effects, there is a
lot of incidental complexity that dependency-based programming deals
with for you. This is especially true when users need to be able to
extend and modify built-in tasks.</p>
<p>The other really exciting feature of Cake is the persistent JVM. I
like the fast startup it provides, but aside from that, a shared,
persistent process just makes sense for a language with concurrency
primitives like Clojure. I love to open up multiple REPLs on the same
JVM and experiment with concurrent code interactively. Or to open a REPL
while a migration is running to check on the status in realtime. This is
something Swank users have been able to experience for a long time, but
Cake brings this to everyone.</p>
<p>Cake’s core philosophy is that tasks should be easy to write. In the
Ruby world, developers end up writing a lot of tasks because Rake makes
it so easy, and that’s a good thing. It was quite a shock when I first
came to Clojure and started using Ant. My build.xml files quickly grew
to hundreds of lines. I found myself copying XML between projects, and I
had to write Java if I wanted reusable tasks.</p>
<p>Programmers don’t want to think about their build tool. They don’t
want to learn a new language to customize their build, and most
programmers don’t want the complexity hidden behind their IDE either.
Programmers want a build tool that is powerful when they need it, but
most of the time, they just want to open up a single file, add a few
lines of code, and get on with the rest of their work.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-aquaman-get-such-a-bad-rap">Why does Aquaman get such a
bad rap?</h3>
<p>If you look into it, you’ll find that almost every person who thinks
Aquaman is lame watched <em>Super Friends</em> when they were a kid.
Other than <em>Super Friends</em>, Aquaman was actually pretty awesome.
The question we should be asking is: Who hated Aquaman so much that they
created an anti-Aquaman propaganda machine and dressed it up as a
children’s TV show? <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3
id="how-does-the-perception-of-tdd-between-the-ruby-and-clojure-communities-differ">How
does the perception of TDD between the Ruby and Clojure communities
differ?</h3>
<p>I never really believed in test driven development, even when I was
in the midst of it. The biggest problem is that TDD makes it too easy to
write bad tests– tests that do more harm than good, like the too-brittle
functional test that breaks every time you change anything, or the
almost useless unit test that stubs so many interactions that it keeps
passing even when everything is totally broken. I’ve wasted too many
days fighting with tests like these.</p>
<p>The hard part about software is writing good abstractions, and tests
are never going to solve that part for you. It seems too many
programmers in the test-driven world write tests before they even
understand the problem. It’s really hard to write good tests this way.
I’m still a big believer in jumping in and starting to program to figure
out your problem. But this only works if you’re willing to throw away
the code that isn’t any good, and maybe people are less likely to do
that if they already have a full suite of passing tests.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: tests are incredibly important for making sure your
implementation does what you designed it to do, but they are deceptively
hard to write well. The best tests are the ones that are written out of
necessity rather than habit. The best tests are the ones written after
you’ve thought hard about your problem and come up with a good design.
If tests are driving development, then tests are also driving design,
and tests</p>
