[Stuart Halloway](http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/tags/clojure) has been hard at work putting together a [getting started with Clojure guide](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started) for those new to the language.  This is highly recommended reading and if you find the information useful then please consider linking to it yourself and contributing to the effort.  

Topics include:

- [Getting Started with Netbeans and Enclojure](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Netbeans_and_Enclojure)
- [Getting Started with Eclipse and Counterclockwise](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Eclipse_and_Counterclockwise)
- [Getting Started with Idea and La Clojure](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Idea_and_La_Clojure)
- [Getting Started with Emacs](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Emacs)
- [Getting Started with Leiningen](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Leiningen)
- [Getting Started with Vim](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Vim)
- [Getting Started with Maven](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Maven)

Also worth noting is [Halloway and Hickey's labrepl](http://github.com/relevance/labrepl) -- a *really* nice way to get a Clojure REPL up and running with learning material attached to boot!
