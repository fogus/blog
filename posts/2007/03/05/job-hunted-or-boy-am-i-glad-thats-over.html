Things have certainly changed in the word of programmer job hunting
since my last foray 6 long years ago. At that time the bubble was alive
and er… bubbling, and companies were so desperate to hire that they
overlooked many minor flaws; like lack of programming ability. The
industry of 2007 however is a bit tighter and much more picky about
hiring talent, and thus was the environment as I searched for a new job
over the past month. The most interesting aspect of the new interviewing
environment is the insistence on asking highly technical questions of
interviewees. The first three interviews that I went on consisted mainly
of
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_%28synchronization%29">Java</a>
and
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_table">C++</a>
grilling which I fortunately felt comfortable in. However, the 4th
interview was decidedly non-technical in nature leading me to wonder
WTF? The pinnacle came during my marathon interview with a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com">little company in
California</a>. Although I would love to get into details, I’m pretty
sure that they forbid it in the NDA that I had signed prior to flying
out there. Let’s just say that it was freaking tough. At the end of the
job hunt cycle, I decided to stay in the Distributed Simulation field
working on the
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TENA">next
generation</a> simulation
<a href="https://www.tena-sda.org">middleware</a>. The system is aimed
at a wide range of platforms and therefore the development environment
is open for interpretation… in other words, I am going to push for a
sweet <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/">Mac Pro</a>
system with
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>. One
can dream anyway. The team that I will be working with is chock full of
geniuses, and I will be hard-pressed to keep up — but really, there is
nothing more motivating than that.
