<p>Things have certainly changed in the word of programmer job hunting since my last foray 6 long years ago.  At that time the bubble was alive and er... bubbling, and companies were so desperate to hire that they overlooked many minor flaws; like lack of programming ability.  The industry of 2007 however is a bit tighter and much more picky about hiring talent, and thus was the environment as I searched for a new job over the past month.  The most interesting aspect of the new interviewing environment is the insistence on asking highly technical questions of interviewees.  The first three interviews that I went on consisted mainly of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_%28synchronization%29">Java</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_table">C++</a> grilling which I fortunately felt comfortable in.  However, the 4th interview was decidedly non-technical in nature leading me to wonder WTF?  The pinnacle came during my marathon interview with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com">little company in California</a>.  Although I would love to get into details, I'm pretty sure that they forbid it in the NDA that I had signed prior to flying out there.  Let's just say that it was freaking tough.  At the end of the job hunt cycle, I decided to stay in the Distributed Simulation field working on the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TENA">next generation</a> simulation <a href="https://www.tena-sda.org">middleware</a>.  The system is aimed at a wide range of platforms and therefore the development environment is open for interpretation... in other words, I am going to push for a sweet <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/">Mac Pro</a> system with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>.  One can dream anyway.  The team that I will be working with is chock full of geniuses, and I will be hard-pressed to keep up â€” but really, there is nothing more motivating than that.</p>
