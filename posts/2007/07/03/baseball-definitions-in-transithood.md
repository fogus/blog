<b>IN-TRANSITHOOD</b>
The condition of a major league player who was once a star player (length of time is irrelevant) to retain perceived value far above his quantifiable value for many years after his ability goes super-nova.  Very often, said player's quantifiable worth is replaced by high levels of veteranicity, spunkitude, and youngster mentorocity.  It is believed that the easiest way for a player to accumulate in-transithood is for him to perform extremely well during the playoffs, and/or hit over .330 for at least one season.<br/>
