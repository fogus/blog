Well, <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/jag/">James
Gosling</a> didn’t tag me, but I’m going to try and start my own branch
— so here now are 5 things about me that you didn’t know:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I severed the tip of my left ring-finger in a horrible washing machine
motor accident and it was successfully re-attached. I no longer have
feeling in that finger however.
</li>
<li>
I worked exactly 10 hours at Friendly’s restaurant in Severna Park MD
prior to going to college. I walked out after being called stupid by the
assistant manager.
</li>
<li>
… I then worked at a car wash in Annapolis as a cashier. That specific
location hired mostly men on work release from the local prison and I
learned many lessons from that crowd. For example, did you know that you
can smoke crack using only a combination lock? One day I casually
mentioned to one of the guys that the vending machine could be thwarted
by attaching tape to a dollar bill and pulling it out of the feeder
after receiving credit. The next day the machine was empty.
</li>
<li>
My first computing job was with Veridian Systems in California, MD
writing the operating system for their PCI Bit-Sync. This was when I was
still in college at SMCM
</li>
<li>
My first Objective C project was an
<a target="_blank" href="http://newark.pardey.org/book/cryptonomicon/slide61.html">Ordo-</a>mode
plugin to
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I now tag
<a target="_blank" href="http://m00se.wordpress.com/">Sarah</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://damnthatscool.com/">Ben</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaldistortion.org/">Shawn</a>,
and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.modus-tollens.com">Yuki</a>.
