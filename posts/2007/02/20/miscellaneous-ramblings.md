<p>OK, I gett it... the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> is killer and all, but there is one part of it that really does not interest me: the phone part.  Can I get one without that feature?  Everything else seems pretty cool, except for that minor thing.  I've decided to switch from <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.minotaurcomputing.com/www.moleskine.com">Moleskine</a> notebooks to National Brand #53-108... I need more surface area when notetaking.  I have a bunch of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Shadows">Dark Shadows</a> postcards that I stick to the front.  I wonder if I could get away with switching to OSX at work full-time?  Could I?  I tend to do 99% Java (and its subsidiaries), Python, and Perl, so in theory it should work.  Would I want to, or will FC6 suffice?  Does anyone use PHP anymore?  I am totally sick of the lazy naming of FOSS projects to be "Yet Another Blah Blah Blah."  My first programming language was BASIC.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.javac.info/">Closures in Java</a> are cool.  I reread Cathedral and the Bazaar recently, moved on to Crypto, and now am stuck.  What's next?  Sci-Fi or Fantasy?  Instant messaging has become worthless for me.  I have to get my groove back on that front.  I actually think that Eric Clapton is damn good at singing the blues.  I like Fiona Apple's voice.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> is the way to go.  Whenever I cannot remember a person's name I refuse to introduce them.  Maybe people think I am being enigmatic when this happens, but really it's because I am a jerk.  I am from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blogthings.com/virginia.html">Virginia</a>... it's true.  </p>
