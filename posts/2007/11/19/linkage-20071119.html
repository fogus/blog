Here is the 3.0 release at last! It has full support for mobiles, and
four of the games were specifically adapted to run nicely on mobiles.
There have been major structural changes to the project (and the zip is
more than twice as large now).

<blockquote>
The original intent of templates was to support generic programming,
which can be summarized as ``reuse through parameterization’’. Generic
functions and objects have parameters which customize their behavior.[*]
These parameters must be known at compile time (i.e. must be statically
bound).

Introduction</a><br/>
<blockquote>
F# provides a language in which functional programming is easy and
expressive, while at the same time practical and well-connected to the
underlying .NET type-system and programming model. A exciting language
for the .NET platform indeed!

Python composition vs. inheritance</a><br/>
<blockquote>
To illustrate the confusion, take your Pet-Owner example. When you say
“A Pet has an Owner”, the verb “to have” has the sense of “to possess”.
But possession alone is <em>not</em> the right sense of “to have” to
suggest using containment.

Google provides three versions of the SDK; one for Windows, one for Mac
OSX (intel) and one for Linux (x86). They also provide two development
environments – one is Eclipse based, and the other is a “roll your own.”
The Eclipse based environment is quite feature-rich and should suffice
for most developers. There is no reason that you can’t use both Eclipse
and “roll your own.”

did Symbolics fail?</a><br/>
<blockquote>
The MacIvory was a Symbolics Ivory chip (yes, we made our own CPU chips)
that plugged into the NuBus (oops, long-since gone) on a Macintosh
(oops, not the leading platform). Later, they finally gave up on
competing with the big chip makers, and made a plug-in board using a
fast chip from a major manufacturer: the DEC Alpha architecture (oops,
killed by HP/Compaq, should have used the Intel). By this time it was
all too little, too late.

Theory</a><br/>
<blockquote>
What type theory does is create a new kind of collection object, called
a type. The idea behind types is to create a stratification, similar to
the idea behind ordered logics. In first order logic, you can only
reason about primitive atoms, not about predicates. In second order
logic, you can reason about atoms and first-order predicates, but not
second-order predicates. And so on.

Multics was conceived as a general purpose time-sharing utility. It
would be a commercial product for GE, which sold time-sharing services.
It became a GE and then Honeywell product. About 85 sites ran Multics.
However, it had a powerful impact in the computer field, due to its many
novel and valuable ideas.

There are quite a few approaches out there which more or less do the

DSL with its 50MB footprint includes rsync). So using other tools might
be more convenient, but I’ll stick with the omnipresent rsync.

I recently read a blog post by someone (forgot the name) suggesting to
use code highlighting for showing other things than syntax. One example
was to show code age, i.e. which revision a line of code belongs to.
This could be useful to find a newly introduced bug by having a visual
indication of the age of each line.

<blockquote>
Recently I got a chance to play with the CommodoreOne being developed by
Jeri Ellsworth, and found that even though it was great working on a
P2S/2 style keyboard, it was darned hard to do any stuff with graphics
symbols since they aren’t printed on the keys. (one of the reasons I
don’t do serious Commodore stuff via the emulators too) So, knowing ‘I
can do something about this’ I have went to work on generating the key
legends for IBM/Mac Keyboards.
