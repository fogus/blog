<p>I have again changed my mind.  I was going to add to the story started last year, and that still holds.  However, I have decided to work on all of the stories currently rattling around in my melon.  That is, I will write as many words as possible, for each of the stories that I have wanted to work on for a while, including:</p>

<em>Butter</em> (currently at ~20,000 words)

<em>Fetid Water</em> (currently at ~2000 words)

<em>Document of the Dead</em> (currently at ~4000 words)

<em>Federation</em> (currently only an outline)
