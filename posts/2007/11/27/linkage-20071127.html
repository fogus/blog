Osdev: USB Boot Sector</a><br/>
<blockquote>
The code works as expected in Bochs (though I treat it as a hard disk
image). I have made the assumption that USB keys are treated like hard
disks. That is, it loads the first sector of the device and checks the
boot sig, etc.

While creating the 2nd presentation, I found a couple things that
surprised me. The first is how popular Flex is - not only in job
listings, but also in skilled developers and mailing list traffic. Below
is a graph that shows how there aren’t many jobs for most of the
frameworks, but there’s lots for Flex.

You’re a Crappy Programmer</a><br/>
<blockquote>
Developers who actively seek to apply patterns to every coding problem
are adding unnecessary complexity. Far from being something you look to
add to your code, you should feel bad every time you are forced to code
up another design pattern, it means you are doing busy work that makes
things more complex and is of dubious benefit. But hey, your code has
design patterns, and no one can take that from you.

OK, people often find it most convenient to do State using “Monads”. I
think I’m going to leave that for now, and just thread state explicitly.
Mainly because I haven’t yet got around to learning how to use the State
Monad. Hopefully this will eventually become annoying enough that it
will give me impetus to learn the monadic version.

Osdev: Page table location</a><br/>

The Intel scheme doesn’t use a page table per segment – it uses the
segmentation hardware to map to a linear virtual address space, and then
uses the paging system to map this to physical memory.

It’s sad, the way things turned out for Be. Having been involved in
several other “great technology meets questionable corporate practice
and/or harsh market conditions” situations in the last ~8 years or so,
this isn’t a shock. But even though I wasn’t actually working for Be,
several of my friends were, and as well, this was the technology that
should have had a chance.

On the tomb is depicted the Latin text “Et in arcadia ego” (”I am also
