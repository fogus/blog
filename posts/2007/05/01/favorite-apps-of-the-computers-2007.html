<p>
In the grand old tradition, I will highlight some of my favorite
computer applications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Text Editor</strong><br> <u>Winner:</u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a><br>
For the 3rd straight year I have to give the medal to the quintessential
operating system, errrr, shell, errr… text editor? The only downside is
that it has taken me the past 3 years to finally become productive with
it.
</p>
<p>
<u>Runner-up(s):</u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.textpad.com/products/textpad/index.html">TextPad</a><br>
Textpad for windows slightly edges
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>
for OSX.
</p>
<p>
<strong>IDE</strong><br> <u>Winner:</u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a><br> I am
constantly amazed at what Eclipse can do. I spend more of my time in
Eclipse than any other piece of software ever (except for perhaps Dragon
Warrior).
</p>
<p>
<u>Runner-up(s):</u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a><br>
NetBeans is included simply to allow for a runner-up, but I tend to
spend very little time there. I do enjoy the Java GUI builder and will
use it on occasion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Operating System</strong><br> <u>Winner:</u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OSX</a><br> Now
that I have switched to using OSX at both work and home, I can finally
put it on the top of my list. There is very little that I can point to
as being deficient in it and with a full-blown *nix underneath I finally
feel at home. That’s not to say that I buy into the
<a target="_blank" href="http://cache.gizmodo.com/gadgets/images/iProduct.gif">iProduct</a>
mentality that comes with Apple products; instead I want only to get
things done as quickly and as painlessly as possible… OSX provides that
for me.
</p>
<p>
<u>Runner-up(s):</u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kubuntu.org">Kubuntu Linux</a><br>
It took many years, but the Redhat/Fedora supremacy in my life has been
broken. I suppose it was yum that finally broke me of my love affair
with Redhat/Fedora, but really it’s the simplicity of Kubuntu that
finally grabbed me (also, see KDE below).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Programming Language</strong><br> <u>Winner: </u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a><br> While
Python is no longer the stylish language that it once was, I am still
fascinated by it. I thought that I had a solid grasp on it, but that was
before I discovered generators and closures. It’s like being a kid
again.
</p>
<p>
<p><u>Runner-up(s):</u> Java<br></p>
Java is my language of trade, but that doesn’t prevent me from enjoying
every minutes of using it. I have expanded my exposure to Java into the
webapp realm, and this has helped to fuel my passion for using it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Browser</strong><br> <u>Winner: </u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a><br>
With the creation of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxmarks.com">Foxmarks</a>, I love
it even more.
</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Instant Messenger</strong><br> <u>Winner: </u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.adiumx.com">Adium</a><br></p>
Supplanted Trillian as my messenger of choice. In reality, it would have
done so earlier had I access to IM at work at my previous job.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Desktop Environment</strong><br> <u>Winner: </u> KDE<br> Perhaps
it was a product of the hardware, or perhaps it was simply the packaging
with Fedora, but I found Gnome to be unusable. I grew up with Gnome and
used it since the beginning, but the constant freezes, crashes, and
inconsistencies that I was experiencing disgusted me. I had to move on.
Since doing so, I have not had any issues with my window manager.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Paranoia Software: Silence on the Wire</strong><br>
<u>Winner:</u> <a target="_blank" href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a><br>
Originally funded by the United States Navy (now open source), Tor
provides a suite of tools for anonymous web activity. It’s not 100%
reliable, but it provides a level of security above and beyond an open
pipe to the Internets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Paranoia Software: Secure Deletion</strong><br> <u>Winner:</u>
<a target="_blank" href="http://wipe.sourceforge.net">Wipe</a><br> Wipe
is an easy to use command line utility to securely delete files and
folders in a *nix environment. The software has not been updated in over
a year, but I have my own local copy that I carry around and have
modified a bit that works well for me.
