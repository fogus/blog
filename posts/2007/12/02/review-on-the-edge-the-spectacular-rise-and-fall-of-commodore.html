<p>I liked this book quite a bit, but I have always had a soft spot for
tech-story books, even the fantasy of the Apple story. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a> was my first
computer at the age of
<a href="http://www.earthvssoup.com/2004/01/13/129/">9</a> and I loved
it with all my heart. I wrote my college entry essays on it when my
peecee broke and was accepted to all of them
(<a href="http://www.smcm.edu">errr</a>….
<a href="http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/">both</a>). The interesting
thing to note is that Commodore gets very little credit for
revolutionizing the PC industry even though it can be said that they did
more for it than Apple and IBM combined. But I believe that the reasons
for their relative obscurity in the revolutionizing department are
two-fold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>They sold something like 20 million C64s and dominated the market
for 5 years or so (which in computer years is something like 27
bajillion years). Everyone hates the winner.</p></li>
<li><p>The guys creating the computers were dicks. From
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Tramiel">Tramiel</a>’s
propensity to screwing his distributors (not to mention his employees,
marketers, friends, bosses, etc…) to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Peddle">Peddle</a>’s
dismissal of every other engineer in the world, the players involved
tended toward antisocial behavior and had over inflated views of
themselves. On more than one occasion
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bil_Herd">someone</a> describes
themselves as having a samurai’s spirit or some such nonsense, while
often talking about how superior their brain cases were. At least Apple
had the lovable
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Woz</a> and while
IBM was Borg, they were at least nameless and faceless
automata.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So that’s it. It’s still a nice read, and highly recommended for
those in love with computer folklore. Just don’t expect to find many
heroes.</p>
<p>-m</p>
<p>p.s. I should say that I truly think that for a time, those
aforementioned dickweeds were absolutely revolutionary with their
creations. And I should say that not everyone involved was detestable;
in fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Miner">Jay Miner</a>
was supposedly a well loved cuddly bear of a genius. I am happy that the
Commodore story has been told, and I absolutely plan on studying this
book again in the future.</p>
