<p>Miguel Tejada was traded today to the Houston Astros for a package of
<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/scottlu01.shtml">Luke
Scott</a>,
<a href="http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/A/Matthew-Albers.shtml">Matt
Albers</a>,
<a href="http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/P/Troy-Patton.shtml">Troy
Patton</a>,
<a href="http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/S/Dennis-Sarfate.shtml">Dennis
Sarfate</a>, and
<a href="http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/C/Mike-Costanzo.shtml">Michael
Costanzo</a>. On the surface this trade seems like a quantity over
quality scenario, but there are a few things to take into
consideration:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>There is some speculation that Tejada will be listed on the
<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3151479">Mitchell
Report due out tomorrow</a> <br/></li>
<li>Tejada’s OPS looks like this:<br/>
<div id="ops" style="width:300px;height:150px;">

</div></li>
</ul>
<script id="source" language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
$(function () { var data = [[2004, 894], [2005, 864], [2006, 877], [2007, 799]]; $.plot($("#ops"), [data],{xaxis:{tickDecimals:0}})});
</script>
<br/> * Tejada’s
<a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?mode=viewstat&stat=143">Rate</a>
looks like this:<br/>
<div id="rate" style="width:300px;height:150px;">

</div>
<script id="source" language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
$(function () { var data = [[2004, 111], [2005, 102], [2006, 99], [2007, 88]]; $.plot($("#rate"), [data],{xaxis:{tickDecimals:0}})});
</script>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Bearing just those three items in mind, one can view Tejada’s market
value more clearly. Was he worth what the rumors declared; namely
<a href="http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/W/Brandon-Wood-1.shtml">Wood</a>
and
<a href="http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/A/Nick-Adenhart.shtml">Adenhart</a>?
I certainly wouldn’t make that trade. The fact that we got what we did
is astonishing to me. Let’s look at what we got.<br/></p>
<strong>Luke Scott</strong><br/> The guy is old. Twenty-nine years old
for a guy who has only 663 ABs in the major leagues is not a great
return, but who will really care in 3 years when he goes FA? There are a
couple of key points to think about:
<ol>
<li>
Scott has spent a career in the minors and has pretty good power numbers
and has shown good patience (.534 SLG and .366 OBP in 1923 ABs)
</li>
<li>
Our other option in LF?
<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/p/paytoja01.shtml">Jay
Payton</a>. nuff said.
</li>
<li>
Given 500+ ABs he could conceivably put up an OPS of .850 for
<strong>below market value</strong> – let’s see Payton do that
</li>
<li>
It’s possible that he could be used as filler for another, yet to be
announced trade – although I will not hold my breath on this one.
</li>
<li>
His stats look suspiciously like… uhhh… Miguel Tejada’s!
</li>
</ol>
<p><br/> <strong>Matthew Albers</strong><br/> Albers is a throw-away
addition if you ask me. His numbers do not stand out in any way, unless
you like that he struck out 9.37 per 9 innings in the minors. Otherwise,
meh.<br/> <br/> <strong>Troy Patton</strong><br/> Patton could prove a
decent return. His numbers project to about a #4 or 5 starter. Those are
important right?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dennis Sarfate</strong><br/> It
seems that in Sarfate we have a clone of Albers above. Those two are so
redundant it’s silly to acquire them both. Personally, I would have
rather let the Astros keep them both and just taken
<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/e/everead01.shtml">Adam
Everett</a> instead, but I have a bit of a man-crush on him, so all
caveats on bias should be considered.<br/> <br/> <strong>Mike
Costanzo</strong><br/> Pitcher turned outfielder who showed some pop in
AA, albeit at 23 years old. Good walks numbers from Costanzo make him
look just like the kind of player that I like. <br/> <br/> Overall, the
Tejada trade is not very sexy, but what can you expect for an aging
declining malcontent? It’s surprising that the Orioles did not get
Everett in the trade because our
<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/hernalu01.shtml">options at
SS now looks very bleak</a>, but perhaps they have other plans – one can
never tell with this team.<br/> -m</p>
