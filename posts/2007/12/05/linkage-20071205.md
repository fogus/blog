<blockquote>The group was starting to realize that the Newton platform was way over budget on RAM. There was some neat work done by the kernel team to reduce the stack and other memory needed for threads, and I did some work in the heap managers to minimize virtual memory usage and fragmentation, but it was clear that we wouldn’t have enough RAM to store as much user data as we would need to; even reducing the application heap, we’d need another 128K or more to make people (ahem: Marketing) happy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Clojure multimethods are a simple yet powerful mechanism for runtime polymorphism that is free of the trappings of OO, types and inheritance. The basic idea behind runtime polymorphism is that a single function designator dispatches to multiple independently-defined function definitions based upon some value of the call.</blockquote>
