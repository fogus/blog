<blockquote>
Sleeping village

Red sun rising in the sky,
Sleepin' village, cock'rel's cry
Soft breeze blowin' in the trees
Peace of mind, feel at ease

Now the first day that i met ya
I was looking in the sky,
When the sun turned all a blur and the thunder clouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver and the wind began to moan,
It must of been a sign for me to leave you well alone
I was born without you baby but my feelings were a little bit too strong

You never said you love meand i don't believe you can,
'cos i saw you in a dream and you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual and i tried to look the same,
But now i've got to love ya,
Tell me who am i to blame?
I was born without you baby but my feelings were a little bit too strong

Now the whole wide world is movin
''cos there's iron in my heart,
I just can't keep from cryin' 'cos you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as i stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away a love i've never known
I was born without you baby but my feelings were a little bit too strong,
Just a little bit to strong

Now the whole wide world is movin''cos there's iron in my heart,
I just can't keep from cryin' 'cos you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as i stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love i've never known
I was born without you baby but my feelings were a little bit too strong,
Just a little bit to strong
