<blockquote>A modest collection of productivity software is included with the Eee, most notably the OpenOffice.org (OOo) office suite. Unfortunately, OOo is sluggish and memory-intensive, which makes it a poor choice for a laptop with limited system resources.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001022.html">Ugly Code? Who cares?</a><br/>
<blockquote>Sure, we programmers are paid to care what the code looks like. We worry about the guts of our applications. It's our job. We want to write code in friendly, modern languages that make our work easier and less error-prone. We'd love any opportunity to geek out and rewrite everything in the newest, sexiest possible language. It's all perfectly natural.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I ended up writing a module for lambda calculations. It is a bit too involved to discuss in detail here, let me just note that it uses normal order evaluation, accepts Prolog terms as basic values, and allows to use global functions (or Lisp special forms) defined either as lambdas or as binary Prolog predicates.</blockquote>
