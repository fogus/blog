Python generators are very interesting beasts. Essentially, they are
functions that can be invoked numerous times while maintaining their
state between calls. This is an incremental process defined by the way
that the <strong>yield</strong> keyword is used in the function. That
is, every call to the generator’s next() method will return the result
of the successive yield within said function. Since I am currently using
Python to write a modern version of the famous
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnd_%28computer_game%29">dnd</a>
game, I have been striving for a useful way to use generators — and I
believe I have found one.

In the word of RPG weapon proficiencies, how would one define the
relationship between increased proficiency and weapon usage? One
possible way could be to envision perfect proficiency as a unit circle
whose area is completely filled. Therefore, gaining proficiency is
represented by more and more of the circle being filled as the weapon is
used. This analogy can be easily simulated using Python generators (as
described in
<a target="_blank" href="http://linuxgazette.net/index.html">Linux
Gazette</a> #100). First, we define a function that returns an
increasingly accurate estimation of pi and use that as a comparison
against our perfect proficiency circle:
</p>
<pre>def proficiency():
    sum = 0
    i = 1.0
    j = 1

    while( True):
        sum = sum + j / i
        yield 4 * sum
        i = i + 2; j = j * -1
</pre>
<p>
Each successive call to the proficiency function will return a closer
and closer approximation for pi. Therefore, in terms of the previous
analogy, the usage of a weapon will, over time, cause the area of the
unit square to become filled closer to full, but will never fill
completely (unless we run out of accuracy). However, the proficiency
function above takes a very long time to converge. This is fine for
things like peripheral weapon proficiencies, but what if one wanted to
simulate natural proficiencies (e.g. Elves and bows)? One way to do this
would be to use a sequence accelerator such as defined by
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler">Euler</a>,
which for brevity’s sake can be written in Python as:
</p>
<pre>def accelerator( prof):
    s0 = prof.next() # Sn-1
    s1 = prof.next() # Sn
    s2 = prof.next() # Sn+1
    while 1:
        yield s2 - (s2 - s1)**2/(s0 - 2*s1 + s2)
        s0, s1, s2 = s1, s2, prof.next()
</pre>
<p>
The function above takes a proficiency function generator as its
parameter. Using the accelerator above allows the proficiency circle to
be filled more accurately, more quickly. Different accelerators can be
used for differing levels of proficiency gains. Neat and elegant.

Here is a Python class, using a generator object, that rolls n number of
s sided dice:
</p>
<pre>from random import randint, seed

class Dice:
    def __init__( self):
        seed()

    #
    # Uses a generator object to return the total of the roll and
    # a tuple of the individual results
    #
    def genRoll( self, num, sides):
        if not ((sides &gt; 0) and (num &gt; 0)):
            return

        total = 0;
        results = []

        for i in range( num):
            roll = randint( 1, sides)
            total += roll
            results.append( roll)

        yield total
        yield tuple( results)

    #
    # Returns only the total of a roll request
    #
    def getTotal( self, num, sides):
        return self.genRoll( num, sides).next()

    #
    # Returns only the individual results tuple of a roll request
    #
    def getSet( self, num, sides):
        gen = self.genRoll( num, sides)
        gen.next()
        return gen.next()

</pre>

What have I been doing all of these years… on a whim I picked up OK
Computer and Amnesiac and am blown away — great albums — been listening
to little else since purchasing them. I’ve always used simplified APIs
built on SAX, so I felt it was time to learn the mechanics of it to
expand the depth of my knowledge on that front.
