<b>SPUNKITUDE</b>
The condition present in certain ball-players often valued far above their quantifiable contributions to a team.  Spunkitude often presents itself in the form of a dirty uniform, bloody arms, nagging injuries, high K/BB rates and often low OBPs.  Very often, players exhibiting high-levels of veteranicity also display a propensity for spunkitude; although one does not follow the other.<br/>
