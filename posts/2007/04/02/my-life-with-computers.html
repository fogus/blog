Not counting the side-projects and toy computer purchases, the time line
of my computer usage is fairly simple:<br>

<br> <strong>Commodore PET</strong><br>
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/Commodore%20Pet200_System.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Commodore Pet"><br>
My first exposure to the world of computation happened probably at the
age of 6. My mother worked at a dispatch center at
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Meade">Fort
Meade</a> in Maryland, and at times she would have to work on weekends
and thus drag me along with her. Although these excursions were
completely boring, I managed to occupy myself with banging on the
keyboard of one of the Commodore PETs located in the office. I’m pretty
sure that it was a PET because the unique design still sticks in my
head. While the computer was NEVER turned on, the seeds of computation
were sown into my brain.

<strong>Commodore 64</strong><br>

My first (and most used) computer was the classic Commodore 64 computer.
I was the first kid on my block to have a computer and was for a time
the most popular… until the girls across the street got a go cart.
Undeterred, I tore through the Programmer’s Reference Guide it seemed a
dozen times. I had all kinds of smiling sprite faces bouncing to and fro
and all over the damn place. It was a blast. I owned that computer for
10 years, and did everything imaginable on it. Some of the products of
my experience include: Baseball statistics trackers and calculators,
hundreds of cracked games, a dozen 20+ level
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_box">Gold
Box</a> characters, D&amp;D NPC/PC generators, and finally my
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.smcm.edu">college</a> application
essay. To this day I will occassionally fire up the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.viceteam.org/">VICE</a> emulator to
try and relive some of the magic.

<strong>Compaq ProLinea 486 SX/25 + Cyrix 686</strong><br>
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/CompaqProlinia4-33.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Compaq Prolinea"><br>
My first PeeCee was the immor(t)al Compaq ProLinea. There were a number
of interesting firsts for me; namely first Linux install, huge RAM, and
huge hard drive space. This was my high school graduation present and
lasted through my first 3 years of college. However, the guts of the
system were ripped out and replaced with a
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrix">Cyrix
686</a> based system. There is not much to say about this computer
except that it afforded me my first attempt at installing Linux. I
vividly remember downloading the entire A set of
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware">Slackware</a>
floppy disks with my 2400 baud modem. It was painful to say the least.
However, after an enormous floppy juggling effort, I had a base install
of Slackware installed on a 20MB partition. The Frankenstein project
that this computer eventually became died of overheating one summer at
school and the remaining salvageable parts were donated to the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/%7Ecasutton/">Charles
Sutton</a> Painted Shoes Computer Fund.

<p><strong>The Borg Machine</strong><br>
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/borg-computer.thumbnail.jpg" alt="The Borg Machine"><br></p>
The Borg machine was essentially a dual Pentium 3 1Ghz Asus motherboard
jammed into the big black cube case sold by
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.servercase.com/">ServerCase</a>. I
loved this machine. I had it running
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE_Linux">multiple</a>
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">flavors</a>
of
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbsd">*nix</a>
on various partitions with a smear of Windows 2000 thrown in for good
measure. It had RAID 0 to start until a drive failure blew up my
installs, after which RAID 1 was the way to go. Did I mention that I
loved that machine? To this day I am not sure why I got rid of it.

<strong>ALR 6×6</strong><br>
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/alr6x6.thumbnail.jpg" alt="alr6x6.jpg"><br>
Oh yeah… I got rid of the Borg Machine because I got a wild hair about
the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanvleet.net/alrbase.html">ALR
6×6</a> machine. While living in DC I came across someone wanting to
trade their busted server for a functional machine. Since the Borg
machine’s brain was getting a bit old, I decided to remove one of the
hard drives, and trade it straight up. One may think it unwise to trade
a functional machine, semi-modern, machine for one that relies on the
Pentium Pro processor, but that simplistic view did not describe the
allure of the 6×6. In a nutshell picture this: LCD access panel, 6-way
symmetric processors, power requirements out the wazoo. The motherboard
was a huge piece of real estate that took 6 Pentium Pro processors,
which at that time were available for peanuts. My rent at the time
included electrical costs, so I couldn’t resist making the trade.
Luckily for me, the machine was salvageable and needed only an obscure
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanvleet.net/alrvrm.html">voltage
regulator module</a> in order to work. However, the road to making that
discovery was long, winding, educational, and at times tedious. I used
that machine for a solid 6 months before giving it up as more trouble
than it was worth, but for a while there it was a blast.

<strong>PowerMac G4</strong><br>
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/PowerMacG4.thumbnail.jpg" alt="PowerMacG4.jpg"><br>
I had been
<a target="_blank" href="http://lowendmac.com/compact/classicii.shtml">playing</a>
<a target="_blank" href="http://lowendmac.com/ppc/7200.shtml">with</a>
<a target="_blank" href="http://lowendmac.com/ppc/6100.shtml">older</a>
<a target="_blank" href="http://lowendmac.com/imacs/blue.shtml">Macs</a>
purchased through my company and/or Ebay for a while before finally
taking the plunge and buying a brand new (err… refurbished) G4. This
shiney piece of eye candy was a pretty sweet ride (dual 500Mhz G4 CPUs
plus 1GB RAM), and gave me my first true departure from the
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a>
architecture since the C64 days.
