<p>As I listen to <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Tago-Mago-CAN/dp/B0011WMHRK/?tag=fogus-20">Paperhouse
by Can</a> I’m reminded of the time that OOP started to really take off.
Believe it or not, the rise of OO was driven by a real need for larger
abstractions to represent increasingly larger and/or more complex
systems. Likewise, the rise of Agile was a response to a real drawback
in the way that systems were created nearly independent of the people
tasked with eventually using them. More recently, the “rebirth” of
functional programming has coincided with the advent of and inherit
complexities in composing semi-congruous mini-systems into a whole.
These are only three examples of potential solutions springing forth
from perceived industry shortfalls and need.</p>
<p>However, in every single case – OOP, Agile, and now functional
programming – the motivations for use have transmogrified from means to
an end, to ends in themselves. This is a failing in the software
industry and indeed one that points more to its pop-science facet than
its computer-science underpinnings.</p>

computing when fashion sense took a backseat to furthering the human
condition.</p>

<p>Speaking of furthering the human condition, there was a time when
programs had names like <em><a
