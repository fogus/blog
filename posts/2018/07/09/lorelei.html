<p>As I listen to “Lorelei” by Cocteau Twins, I’m reminded of last
week’s post where I talked about context-free music and its virtue in my
personal programming head-space. In writing down my thoughts on the
matter I didn’t want to give the impression that there’s a strict
dichotomy between sentiment-driven and context-free music. Indeed, there
are many bands that bridge the gap between the two styles and a more
nuanced musical landscape exists in reality. For example, some amazing
bands that I love dearly that are able to create musical environment AND
express sentiment include: <a

<p>Ever since I was a kid I can remember wishing for a-la carte
television. Rather than cable or rentals I wanted to pay $0.50 here and
$0.25 there to watch specific episodes of specific shows. While that
granularity never materialized, the binge-targeted online video media
publishing houses are moving in the right direction. Further, while
television for a long time has followed the watch-and-immediately-forget
philosophy, the binge-peddlers seem to have brought back the long lost
art of telling a coherent and compelling story.</p>

<p>My favorite kind of sci-fi is the kind where each page contains a
dozen throw-away crazy ideas. A couple of the best in this vein is <a

by Warren Ellis and <a

Zen Gun</a> by Barrington Bayley.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"

<p>When I was a younger man in college I had one floppy disk per class
that I attended. My thinking was that everything that I would need for a
class should fit on a single floppy and go with me in a shirt or
backpack pocket. These disks included everything from my source files,
to editors, to compilers, to essays, to research, to … you get the
point. This thinking was instilled in me at a young age through my
propensity to have a book with me at all times. I’d ride my skateboard
around town with a paperback sticking out of my back pocket. I felt that
any book worth reading was one that could fit into my back pocket.
Indeed, often my choice of reading was wholly driven by the presentation
format. To this day I’m fascinated by portability<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> as
an aesthetic.</p>
<p>For a long time I dreamed of programming a whole suite of useful
applications that could fit onto a single floppy, but the weight of the
task was too much to overcome given my other school requirements. I did
eventually make a useable text editor, but the dream eventually withered
on the vine. That said, the core aesthetic has stuck with me and has
driven my personal design style. I’ll probably talk more about this in
the future.</p>
