<p>As I sit here and listen to <em><a
href="https://ant-zen.bandcamp.com/album/a-seasonal-gift">the
brotherhood of saturn</a></em> by Black Lung &amp; Spiderface I’m
reminded of an old <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFjawZl_Dc">interview with Lisa
Gerrard and Brendan Perry</a> where the former describes music as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a package for sentiment… a form of communication</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And more directly by the latter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(music) moves us to think and feel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinking about my own relationship to music, I can’t help but
identify with the idea of music as a package for sentiment. Indeed, my
earliest musical loves (e.g. Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys) were raw
sentiment. As I get older<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I realize that my tolerance for raw
musical sentiment has lessened and instead I’m drawn more and more to
context-free musical experiences. I suspect the reason for this is that
I spend a lot of my time designing and building software systems. These
creative processes demand a large portion of my attention and frankly
there are few cycles available to process the messages in the music, so
context-free music has thrust itself to the front of my play queue. By
“context-free” I don’t necessarily mean music as stark as say, furniture
music<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Instead, I mean music that, as far
as I can tell, has no discernible message. In this genre I’d place bands
like <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Rifts-CD-Oneohtrix-Point-Never/dp/B009INAMJO/?tag=fogus-20">Oneohtrix
Point Never</a>, <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Bliss-Pantha-Du-Prince/dp/B000M2DJZ4/?tag=fogus-20">Pantha
du Prince</a>, <a
href="https://www.last.fm/music/Montauk/The+Moment+Lasts+A+Second,+But+The+Memory+Lives+On+Forever">Montauk</a>,
<a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Between-Buildings-Trees-ANDREW-THOMAS/dp/B0035KGWE0/?tag=fogus-20">Andrew
Thomas</a>, and of course <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Box-GAS/dp/B01L2SVXAY/?tag=fogus-20">Gas</a>.
These bands create musical environments. These bands create head-spaces.
These bands create near perfect (IMO of course) music to program by.</p>

<p><em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Rings-Saturn-W-G-Sebald/dp/0811226158/?tag=fogus-20">The
Rings of Saturn</a></em> by W.G. Sebald is the closest thing to ambient
in print that I’ve ever read.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’ve been debating what to do with <a
href="http://readevalprintlove.fogus.me">Read/Eval/Print/Love</a> and
while nothing has stuck, the possibilities include: continuing as a
periodic self-published PDF or burning it all to the ground. There is no
in-between.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"

<p>I’ve thrown around 25,000 pitches this year alone and my arm feels
like a ineffective strip of throbbing bacon.</p>
<hr />
<p>To me, the years 1982 to 1985 were the best years in the history of
comic books. 1982 was the year that both Marvel and DC instituted
creator-controled projects which fostered a larger focus on
non-regurgitated super-hero-pablum. While one of my favorite series ever
<em>Ghosts!</em> was cancelled that year, another of my favorites
<em>Marvelman</em> by Alan Moore hit the scenes, completely changing the
super-hero story forever. I was a young kid at the time that this book
came out, so I didn’t read it at the time.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
That said, I can still remember seeing the iconic cover of Daredevil 181
on the shelves at High’s and being infinitely fascinated by it. 1983 saw
the publication of Frank Miller’s <em>Ronin</em> by DC no less. Once
again, another of my favorite titles was cancelled – this time <em>House
of Mystery</em>. Little did I know,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> but Britain was
innovating the landscape mainly via the anthology series
<em>Warrior</em> which hosted the publication of Alan Moore’s <em>V for
Vendetta</em>. A book that I’ve still never read, but was influential to
creators who came later was <em>American Flagg</em> by Howard Chaykin.
In 1984 a bunch of independent publishers sprung up and stories of all
sorts started hitting the scene, but it was a DC comic that truly made
waves. With issue #20, Alan Moore was brought on as the script writer
for <em>Swamp Thing</em> and he demolished the then hokey storylines and
created a truly masterful horror comic book.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Finally, McCarthy and Milligan published their surreal 3-issue
<em>Strange Days</em> which many edgy comic creators credit as
ground-breaking. 1985 was a bit of a whimper compared to the incredibly
fertile 3-years that came before, but independent companies continued to
spring up and the ground was further cultivated for an explosion of
incredibly influential comic stories to come in the subsequent years,
including, but not limited to: <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>The Puma
Blues</em>, <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, <em>Batman: Year One</em>,
and <em>Maus</em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
