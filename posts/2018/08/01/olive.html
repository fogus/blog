<p>Listening to <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Cafe-Apres-Midi-Olive/dp/B00004W9T5/?tag=fogus-20">Cafe
Apres-Midi:Olive</a> I’m reminded that I was once a die-hard adherent to
strong statically typed languages. Since that time I’ve moved into more
dynamic languages, but static thinking and programming still holds a
spot in my heart. Below I’ll just briefly about the aspects of static
languages and type systems that made a deep impression on me.</p>
<h1 id="things-ive-found-to-be-true">Things I’ve found to be true</h1>
<h2 id="design-facilitation">Design facilitation</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of incentive for putting a lot of effort into up-front
design for a well-known domain using a strong statically typed language.
A big benefit comes from modeling your domain such that known illegal
states are, well, illegal to even represent with the data model.</p>
<h2 id="if-it-compiles-its-correct">If it compiles it’s correct</h2>
<p>A lot of thought, preparation, design, and tears go into making this
happen, but when modeling a well-known domain using a strong static type
system you can use the compiler to prove the implementation itself. It
took a lot of understanding and thought to get to this point (for me)
but when I did, it was a thing of beauty.</p>
<h1 id="things-that-ive-found-to-not-be-true">Things that I’ve found to
NOT be true</h1>
<h2 id="there-is-no-connection-to-morality">There is no connection to
morality</h2>
<p>There’s a pernicious thread in the static typing “community” that
tries to tie the use of dynamically typed languages to moral
irresponsibility. While in a twisted way I can understand the chain of
thought, I’m highly skeptical of any actual link. Despite the somewhat
libertine sensibilities, dynamic language practitioners are, IME, just
as rigorous as anyone when it comes to creating robust systems.</p>
<h2 id="no-noticeable-slow-down">No noticeable slow-down</h2>
<p>A view that’s gained some traction is that static languages slow down
the development cycle because they’re less amenable to exploratory
programming. I can’t say for sure if that’s true, but in my time I found
that the allocation of programming time was more backloaded with static
languages compared to dynamic, but I can’t say that I’ve ever observed
an overall development-cycle slow-down.</p>
<h2 id="no-fewer-bugs">No fewer bugs</h2>
<p>I’ve not noticed an overall decrease in production bugs using strong
static languages, but I will say that oft times potential bugs were
caught earlier.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the zeitgeist there’s an increasing interest in the States in
stories and articles easily summarized as “dying alone in Japan.” I
wonder what this says about the zeitgeist…</p>
