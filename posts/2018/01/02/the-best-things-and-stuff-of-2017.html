<h2 id="most-viewed-blog-posts-by-me">Most viewed blog posts by me</h2>
<p>I’ve been scaling back on blogging the past two years and have tried
something different instead - <a
href="http://www.readevalprintlove.org">Read-Eval-Print-λove</a>. That
said, there were a couple of high-traffic posts on my blog.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2017/07/20/pascal-at-apple/">Pascal at
Apple</a> - <em>a post where I explored some of the history of the
Pascal programming language through Apple’s history. Some great
authoritative commentary occurred. More exploration needed.</em></li>

Archeology: The Intelligent Machines Journal – Issue 1 Dec. 78</a> -
<em>I sometimes read old computing journals and try to reason about them
from my present perspective. In this post I explored the first issue of
the journal that would eventually become InfoWorld.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="favorite-technical-books-discovered-and-read">Favorite technical
books discovered (and read)</h2>
<p>I’ve intentionally reduced the number of technical books that I
consume, but there are a few that I “found” in 2017 that are
stellar.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Implementation-Prolog-Princeton-Legacy-Library/dp/069160939X/?tag=fogus-20">The
Implementation of Prolog</a></em> by Patrice Boizumault - <em>I took
some time to explore Prolog implementations in the first half of the
year and this book was indispensable. It’s a niche topic for sure, but
if you’re into it then few books match this gem.</em></li>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Beneath-Apple-ProDOS-Don-Worth/dp/0835904636/?tag=fogus-20">Beneath
Apple ProDOS</a></em> - <em>Continuing my computing archaeology efforts
I found this amazing book of old Apple ProDOS hacks.</em></li>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Machine-Toward-Human-Environment/dp/0262640104/?tag=fogus-20">The
Architecture Machine: Toward a More Human Environment</a></em> - <em>For
many of the early years of computing machines a main idea driving many
in their efforts was the idea of using computers as mind amplification
and augmentation. Negroponte’s book explore this notion of augmentation
with and eye towards human/computer partnership.</em></li>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Clause-Effect-Programming-Working-Programmer/dp/3540629718/?tag=fogus-20">Clause
and Effect</a></em> - <em>In my opinion this is the best introduction to
Prolog that I’ve read so far.</em></li>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717/?tag=fogus-20">Show
Stopper!: The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next
Generation at Microsoft</a></em> - <em>In many ways it’s the standard
non-technical tech book with tales of overnight coding heroism, broken
people, and broken families led by the now legendary (infamous?) Dave
Cutler.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="favorite-non-technical-books-read">Favorite non-technical books

<ul>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Finite-Infinite-Games-James-Carse/dp/1476731713/?tag=fogus-20">Finite
and Infinite Games</a></em> - <em>A game that masquerades about games
but that’s really about life. Fascinating read.</em></li>

companion to <a

- <em>A nice sci-fi find though it’s one that I’ve put off reading for
years. This plays in the same space as the recent film The Arrival, but
does so along a slightly different vector.</em></li>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Wife-Audrey-Niffenegger/dp/1476764832/?tag=fogus-20">The
