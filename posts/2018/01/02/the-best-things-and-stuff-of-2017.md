* *[The most beautiful program ever written](http://paperswelove.org/2017/video/will-byrd-most-beautiful-program/)* - *Will Byrd talks about the half-page LISP interpreter and its stunning beauty. Best talk of 2017 IMO. I found it inspirational even.*

Most viewed blog posts by me
----------------------------

I've been scaling back on blogging the past two years and have tried something different instead - [Read-Eval-Print-λove](http://www.readevalprintlove.org).  That said, there were a couple of high-traffic posts on my blog.

* [Pascal at Apple](http://blog.fogus.me/2017/07/20/pascal-at-apple/) - *a post where I explored some of the history of the Pascal programming language through Apple's history. Some great authoritative commentary occurred. More exploration needed.*
* [Computer Archeology: The Intelligent Machines Journal – Issue 1 Dec. 78](http://blog.fogus.me/2017/11/07/computer-archeology-the-intelligent-machines-journal-issue-1-dec-78/) - *I sometimes read old computing journals and try to reason about them from my present perspective. In this post I explored the first issue of the journal that would eventually become InfoWorld.*

Favorite technical books discovered (and read)
----------------------------------------------

I've intentionally reduced the number of technical books that I consume, but there are a few that I "found" in 2017 that are stellar.

* *[The Implementation of Prolog](https://www.amazon.com/Implementation-Prolog-Princeton-Legacy-Library/dp/069160939X/?tag=fogus-20)* by Patrice Boizumault - *I took some time to explore Prolog implementations in the first half of the year and this book was indispensable. It's a niche topic for sure, but if you're into it then few books match this gem.*
* *[Beneath Apple ProDOS](https://www.amazon.com/Beneath-Apple-ProDOS-Don-Worth/dp/0835904636/?tag=fogus-20)* - *Continuing my computing archaeology efforts I found this amazing book of old Apple ProDOS hacks.*
* *[The Architecture Machine: Toward a More Human Environment](https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Machine-Toward-Human-Environment/dp/0262640104/?tag=fogus-20)* - *For many of the early years of computing machines a main idea driving many in their efforts was the idea of using computers as mind amplification and augmentation. Negroponte's book explore this notion of augmentation with and eye towards human/computer partnership.*
* *[Clause and Effect](https://www.amazon.com/Clause-Effect-Programming-Working-Programmer/dp/3540629718/?tag=fogus-20)* - *In my opinion this is the best introduction to Prolog that I've read so far.*
* *[Show Stopper!: The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717/?tag=fogus-20)* - *In many ways it's the standard non-technical tech book with tales of overnight coding heroism, broken people, and broken families led by the now legendary (infamous?) Dave Cutler.*


Favorite non-technical books read
---------------------------------

* *[Finite and Infinite Games](https://www.amazon.com/Finite-Infinite-Games-James-Carse/dp/1476731713/?tag=fogus-20)* - *A game that masquerades about games but that's really about life. Fascinating read.*
* *[Eichmann in Jerusalem](https://www.amazon.com/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Banality-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039881/?tag=fogus-20)* - *Another triumph by Arendt and a perfect companion to [The Origins of Totalitarianism](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Totalitarianism-Hannah-Arendt/dp/0156701537/?tag=fogus-20). An interesting read for these modern times.*
* *[How Green Was My Valley](https://www.amazon.com/How-Green-Was-My-Valley/dp/0684825554/?tag=fogus-20)* - *This is a classic that somehow flew below my radar my entire life. The book describes the trials and times of a humble rural valley intersecting with industrial sensibilities.*
* *[Babel-17](https://www.amazon.com/Babel-17-Empire-Star-Samuel-Delany/dp/0375706690/?tag=fogus-20)* - *A nice sci-fi find though it's one that I've put off reading for years. This plays in the same space as the recent film The Arrival, but does so along a slightly different vector.*
* *[The Time Traveller's Wife](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Wife-Audrey-Niffenegger/dp/1476764832/?tag=fogus-20)* - *A love story masquerading as a science fiction novel but one that tackles both with incredible feeling and thoughtfulness.*
* *[The Lathe of Heaven](https://www.amazon.com/Lathe-Heaven-Ursula-K-Guin/dp/1416556966/?tag=fogus-20)* - *My favorite sci-fi discovery of the year about a man whose dreams shape reality and those who would take advantage of such power. Riveting!*
