<p>As I listen to “Monster” by <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Live-Steppenwolf/dp/B000002O4H/?tag=fogus-20">Steppenwolf</a>
I’m reminded of my mother. Earlier this year she passed away due to
complications from an infection. As a kid I was surrounded by music. My
mother was alone in raising me for a large portion of my early childhood
and as a result we spent a lot of time together early on. She would
always have her records playing and in addition to Steppenwolf I got an
early dose of Black Sabbath, Rolling Stones, and Moody Blues among
others. This early exposure certainly colored my own musical preferences
even today.</p>

<p>There’s some buzz around Prolog lately and that’s always exciting.
The consequence of buzz however is that the topic tends to find its way
onto <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">the orange site</a>. As
these things go there are infuriating comments intermingled with
illuminating comments floating in a miasmic broth of fake skepticism,
sophistry, and unfounded opinions. That said, here are a few golden
nuggets to ponder:</p>

<p>At the moment I have my own Prolog implementation that I’ve
resurrected from an old codebase which is a pure labor of love (and
pain) called “Folog.” It’s based loosely on the Prolog presented in <a
