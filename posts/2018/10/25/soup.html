<p>As I listen to <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Ege-Bamyasi-Can/dp/B00LX65WE4/?tag=fogus-20">“Soup”
by Can</a> I’m reminded of the <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11808551">time when Alan Kay
took some time to post on Hacker News</a> addressing his thoughts and
ideas about object-oriented programming. For raw context read the
original thread, but in this post I’ll attempt to annotate some of what
was posted. For the purpose of this post anything in italics and all
footnotes are assumed to be my words, blockquotes are questions from
other HN denizens, and everything else are quotes from Dr. Kay.</p>
<h2 id="the-10000ft-view">The 10,000ft view</h2>
<p>I had several stages about “objects”. The first was the collision 50
years ago in my first weeks of (ARPA) grad school of my background in
math, molecular biology, systems and programming, etc., with <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6orsmFndx_o">Sketchpad</a>, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0pEj58xlyU">Simula</a>, and the
proposed <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg_XeRSD6Rg">ARPAnet</a>. This led
to an observation that almost certainly wasn’t original – it was almost
a tautology – that since you could divide up a computer into virtual
computers intercommunicating ad infinitum you would (a) retain full
power of expression, and (b) always be able to model anything that could
be modeled, and (c) be able to scale cosmically beyond existing ways to
divide up computers. I loved this. Time sharing “processes” were already
manifestations of such virtual machines but they lacked pragmatic
universality because of their overheads (so find ways to get rid of the
overheads …)</p>
<p>Though you could model anything – including data structures – that
was (to me) not even close to the point (it got you back into the soup).
The big deal was encapsulation and messaging to provide loose couplings
that would work under extreme scaling (in manners reminiscent of Biology
and Ecology).</p>
<em>
<p style="font-size:8px">
As we know, modern OO programming is all about using classes to define
and model data structures. While the use of interface-first design has
helped manage the complexities added, I wonder if the point is still
missed with this practice.
</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>A second stage was to mix in “the Lisp world” of Lisp itself, <a
href="http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/index.html">McCarthy’s ideas</a>
about <a
href="http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/ascribing.html">robots</a> and
temporal logics, the AI work going on within ARPA (especially at MIT),
and especially <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7erJ1DV_Tlo">Carl Hewitt’s PLANNER
language</a>. One idea was that objects could be like servers and could
be goal-oriented with PLANNER-type goals as the interface language.</p>
<p>A third stage were a series of Smalltalks at Parc that attempted to
find a pragmatic balance between what was inevitably needed in the
future and what could be done on the Alto at Parc (with 128K bytes of
memory, half of which was used for the display!). This was done in
partnership with <a href="https://twitter.com/daningalls?lang=en">Dan
Ingalls</a> and other talented folks in our group. The idealist in me
gritted my teeth, but the practical results were good. A fourth stage
(at Parc) was to deeply revisit the temporal logic and “world-line”
ideas (more on this below).</p>
<em>
<p style="font-size:8px">
A fascinating example of an early Smalltalk is the <a
href="http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/">ST-71 version</a>
that has a somewhat familiar implementation pattern matched with a
logical matching system.
</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>A fifth stage was to seriously think about scaling again, and to look
at e.g. <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091219121402/http://wcat05.unex.es/Documents/Wells.pdf">Gelernter’s
Linda “coordination language”</a> as an approach to do loose coupling
via description matching in a general publish and describe manner. I
still like this idea, and would like to see it advanced to the point
where objects can actually “negotiate meaning” with each other.</p>
<h2 id="mccarthys-temporal-logic-real-functions-in-time">McCarthy’s
Temporal Logic: “Real Functions in Time”</h2>
<p>There’s lots of context from the past that will help understanding
the points of view presented here. I will refer to this and that in
passing, and then try to provide a list of some of the references (I
think of this as “basic CS knowledge” but much of it will likely be
encountered for the first time here).</p>
<p>Most of my ways of thinking about all this ultimately trace their
paths back to John McCarthy in the late 50s. John was an excellent
mathematician<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and logician. He wanted to be able
to do consistent reasoning himself – and he wanted his programs and
robots to be able to do the same. Robots were a key, because he wanted a
robot to be in Philadelphia at one time and in New York at another. In
an ordinary logic this is a problem. But John fixed it by adding an
extra parameter to all “facts” that represented the “time frame” when a
fact was true. This created a simple temporal logic, with a
visualization of “collections of facts” as stacked “layers” of
world-lines.</p>
<p>This can easily be generalized to world-lines of “variables”, “data”,
“objects” etc. From the individual point of view “values” are replaced
by “histories” of values, and from the system point of view the whole
system is represented by its stable state at each time the system is
between computations. Simula later used a weaker, but useful version of
this.</p>
<p>I should also mention <a
href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.332.3161&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Christopher
Strachey</a> – a great fan of Lisp and McCarthy – who realized that many
kinds of programming could be unified and also be made safer by always
using “old” values (from the previous frame) to make new values, which
are installed in a the new frame. He realized this by looking at how
clean “tail recursion” was in Lisp, and then saw that it could be
written much more understandably as a kind of loop involving what looked
like assignment statements, but in which the right hand side took values
from time t and the variables assigned into existed in time t+1 (and
only one such assignment could be made). This unified functional
programming and “imperative like” programming via simulating time as
well as state.</p>
<p>And let me just mention the programming language Lucid, by Ashcroft
and Wadge, which extended many of Strachey’s ideas …</p>
<p>It’s also worth looking at <a
href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=726386">“atomic
transactions”</a> on data bases as a very similar idea with “coarse
grain”. Nothing ever gets smashed, instead things are organized so that
new versions are created in a non-destructive way without race
conditions. There is a history of versions.</p>
<p>The key notion here is that “time is a good idea” – we want it, and
we want to deal with it in safe and reasonable ways – and most if not
all of those ways can be purely functional transitions between sequences
of stable world-line states.</p>
<em>
<p style="font-size:8px">
This is the core idea behind the Datomic database.
</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>The just computed stable state is very useful. It will never be
changed again – so it represents a “version” of the system simulation –
and it can be safely used as value sources for the functional
transitions to the next stable state. It can also be used as sources for
creating visualizations of the world at that instant. The history can be
used for debugging, undos, roll-backs, etc.</p>
<p>In this model – again partly from McCarthy, Strachey, Simula, etc., –
“time doesn’t exist between stable states”: the “clock” only advances
when each new state is completed. The CPU itself doesn’t act as a clock
as far as programs are concerned.</p>
