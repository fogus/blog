<p>While listening to <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Advaitic-Songs-Om/dp/B0083GJ1M6/?tag=fogus-20">Advaitic
Songs by Öm</a> and reading the ACM article “<a
href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/228006-teaching-two-programming-languages-in-the-first-cs-course/fulltext">Teaching
two programming languages in the first CS course</a>” it reminded me of
my faux lesson plan for a college course that no one would ever hire me
to teach. In this course students would indeed use and learn two
programming languages: one language used to write another language.
Preferably the two languages would be of differing paradigms,
e.g. procedural -&gt; functional, functional -&gt; logical. The reason
for this is that the implemented language should expose the downfalls of
the implementation language for certain kinds of problems, and vice
versa. I have not written a syllabus.</p>
<p>As a kid my mother worked with a guy who was into <a
href="https://paleotronic.com/2018/06/15/confessions-of-a-disk-cracker-the-secrets-of-4am/">cracking
Commodore 64 games</a>. Since I had a C64 he told her that he’d be happy
to hook me up with free software and sent her home with a 30+ page list
of warez that he had in his collection. I remember looking at the list
and drooling at the long list of games that he had, but for some reason
I was more interested in checking out the “business software.” I had
played games and I knew what they had to offer, but business software
was a different beast. So one day he sent a few disks home jam packed
with word processors, spreadsheets, tax software, and the like. I spent
hours exploring those programs (without manuals) and feel like I learned
a lot about interface design and revelatory purpose in software. I guess
I’m just not much of a game player.</p>
