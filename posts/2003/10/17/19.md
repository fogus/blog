I've been practicing Taekwondo for about 1.5 years and have still not achieved a full side or front split.  I had all but given up both crusades.  However, thanks to some advise from Master Kevin McMahon (hip rotation) I have made it my personal mission to hit the floor in my splits within 3 months.  Therefore, I give you:

<br />Front Right: 9" from ground
<br />Front Left:   8" from ground
<br />Side Split:    18" from ground
