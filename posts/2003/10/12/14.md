<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/10/10/panther.html">O'Reilly Network: Ten Things I Dig About Panther [Oct. 10, 2003]</a>: "One question I anticipate that I'll be asked quite a bit in the next few months is: 'Should I upgrade?' The answer is, from my perspective, a resounding 'YES'. This is a landmark release of the system. Each version since 10.0 has upped the ante significantly."

<br />A pretty good list of highlights for OSX.3 (Panther).  Drool.  I especially like the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">XCode</a> IDE coming out.  If I understand correctly, one can use Rendevous aware computers on a network to distribute build-loads.  Of course, I will barely be able to afford one system, and I'll be damned before my company forks some cash-flow toward Apple hardware, so this feature helps me not... but damn is it cool!
