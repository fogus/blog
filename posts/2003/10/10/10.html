<p>A fax sent to Roy Horn from
<a href="http://www.peta.org" target="viewer">PETA</a> on October 6th,
2003. <br /> <br /><i>Roy Horn and Siegfried Fischbacher<br />c/o
University Medical Center Community Relations<br />1800 W. Charleston
Blvd.<br />Las Vegas, NV 89102 <br /> <br />Dear Roy and Siegfried:
<br /> <br />First, let me express our best wishes and sincere hope that
Roy will make a full recovery. <br /> <br />As you might imagine, our
warm wishes also include a plea to get out of the sad business of
breaking the spirit of wild animals and forcing them to perform. Perhaps
Friday’s frightening incident will make you realize that a brightly lit
stage with pounding music and a screaming audience is not the natural
habitat for tigers, lions, or any other exotic animals. The only natural
thing that happened on that stage was that this majestic animal lashed
out against a captor who was beating him with a microphone because he
wouldn’t do a trick. No matter how much you say that you love the wild
animals whom you have confined continents away from their natural homes,
you are still the men who have subjugated their wills and natures to
further your own careers. <br /> <br />We, as well as thousands who’ve
called us from around the world, urge you and the Mirage to use some of
the millions of dollars you’ve made from exotic animals to build a
state-of-the-art sanctuary and immediately retire Montecore and all the
other animals in your compound. You are now in a unique position to show
the world both that you have lived and learned and that you have true
respect for animals by leaving them some shred of the life that nature
intended. <br /> <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br /> <br />Dan
Mathews<br />Vice President <br /></i> <br /> <br />Take from this what
you will. <br />-m <br /></p>
