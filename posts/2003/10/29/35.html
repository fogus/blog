<p>Here for your amusement, ridicule, or admiration is the first draft
text of my final project proposal for my Artificial Intelligence class.
Feel free to offer suggestions, poke fun, or correct my wretched
grammar.<br />
<br /> <br /><i>Begin</i> <br />The intention of my final project and
the subsequent presentation will be to illustrate the strength of
genetic algorithm techniques for searching intractable problem sets. The
problem in question is contrived, but is complex enough to be virtually
insolvable by conventional search techniques.<br />
<br /> <br />The Problem <br /> <br />In order to properly demonstrate
the usefulness of genetic algorithms, a problem had to be constructed
that was both simple in design yet extremely complex to solve using
conventional methods. The design that was created involves a simple game
based loosely on Knuth’s PAC-world, which involves an adversarial
relationship between two entities whose behavior is determined by fifty
simple factors. These entities are pitted against one another in a fight
for survival, the result of which is determined only by the subtle
interactions between the fifty factors mentioned above. These entities
will age, kill one another, give birth, and die of ‘old age’. The entity
with the highest population at the end of a fixed amount of time will be
declared to have the stronger attributes. The intractable nature of this
scenario is in determining the proper combination of attributes that
will create an entity capable of surviving against any opponent.<br />
<br /> <br />The Entities <br /> <br />The individual entities will each
have fifty attributes that will determine their behavior when confronted
with certain conditions within the game world.<br />
<br /> <br />1. Birth Factors (4 values) <br /> a. These properties
determine the behavior of a newly born entity into an empty cell in the
world. An entity is born into an empty cell if another entity of the
same family is facing that cell and is the stronger species. The Birth
Factors determine how this new entity is born, that is, the attributes
determine the direction that it will face given its parents age.
<br />2. Replacement Factors (16 values) <br /> a. When a cell in the
world is occupied by an entity A and faced by a stronger enemy entity B,
then the cell occupied by A is replaced by a newborn entity of type B.
The Replacement Factors determine the direction that the newborn will be
in given B’s age and the direction of the original A entity that was in
the cell. <br />3. Edge Factors (3 values) <br /> a. When a round ends,
any entities facing the edge of the world will be turned according to
the Edge Factors and age. <br />4. Empty Factors (3 values) <br /> a.
When a round ends, any entities facing an empty cell in the world and is
not being attacked will be turned according to the Empty Factors and
age. <br />5. Friendly Factors (12 values) <br /> a. When a round end,
any entities facing an entity of the same family will be turned
according to its age and the age of the entity that it faces. <br />6.
Enemy Factors (12 values) <br /> a. When a round end, any entities
facing an enemy entity will be turned according to its age and the age
of the enemy that it faces. <br /> <br />The combination of all of the
factors above coupled with the age of the individuals within the world
work to create an incredibly complex problem fro determining powerful
combinations of properties. <br /> <br />The Goal <br /> <br />Using the
description above, I will attempt to design a genetic algorithm
including an appropriate fitness function to attempt to find powerful
combinations. This will be done by: <br />· Creating a strategy for
pitting entity families against one another <br />· Determining the
winners after a certain fixed number of rounds <br />· Combining strong
attributes between families in order to attempt to create stronger
decedents <br />· Introducing random mutations to avoid stagnation
<br /> <br />The Implementation <br /> <br />The program to perform the
project specifications will be written in Common Lisp. <br /> <br />-m
