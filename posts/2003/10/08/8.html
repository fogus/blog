<p>So California has elected the Terminator as its Governor. This fact
is raising quite a stir with those outside of CA. However, if one were
to think rationally about this situation, then the logic of the results
become clear. Being a governor is no easy task, so who else is more
suited for the job than a single-minded killing machine from the future?
Not only does he already know what’s going to happen, but he has that
cool info-vision that can flash the latest budget numbers (albeit in
COBOL) in his field of vision. Not to mention his AMD Athlon TX 256-bit
(10 GHz FSB) brain (with 64 terrabytes of bubble memory) – which is
perfect for ‘crunching the numbers’. I haven’t even gotten into the
incredible leadership displayed in Kidergarten Cop, and his almost
omniscient planning skills shown in both Commando and Predator. The guy
rocks! If we had only elected a guy like this to the presidency; the war
on terrorism would’ve be in the bag.<br />
