<p><a href="http://www.the-shadow-government.com/main.htm">The Secret
Plans for National Emergencies</a>: “On March 11, 2002, the Washington
Post reported that a secret, parallel ‘shadow government’ had been
activated in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
According to the Post, over 100 secret civilian managers of the federal
government had been transported by helicopters on September 11 to secure
underground shelters outside Washington. Each underground shelter
contained enough food, water, medicine, power generation facilities, and
other supplies to let it function for over three months completely
sealed off from the outside world. The Post reported that teams of
federal executives were being rotated at 90-day intervals to live and
work in the underground facilities. They remained sealed inside for the
duration of their assignments; they were not allowed to bring their
families and, in fact, could only say they were on a ‘business trip.’
Those managers would be the ones running America if a catastrophic
terrorist attack (such as a nuclear weapon) wiped out the civilian
leadership in Washington.” <br /> <br />The infamous ‘Shadow Government’
gets a once-over by this frequent Coast To Coast AM guest.<br />
