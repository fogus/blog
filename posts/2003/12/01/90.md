Whew!  What a holiday.  Luckily, the bulk of my flu went away before Thanksgiving hit, so I was able to help Yuki fix dinner for 14 on Thursday.  By some amazing stroke of luck we were able to complete all of the menu items almost simultaneously.  I cannot seem to properly time the completion of eggs and toast simultaneously on a typical day, so I have no idea what happened on Thursday -- lucky I guess.  Thank you Yuki, Mom, Joe, Jamie, Grandmom, Aki, Yoshya, Leon, Leyla, Sakai-san, Ryota, Emiko, and Takahashi for making Thanksgiving a blast.
