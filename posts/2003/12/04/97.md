I have been sick for far too long!  Today marks the 2 week anniversary of my flu.  I have not been able to train for 16 days, and my appetite is almost nil.  For the first few days I was running a temperature of 102, but since that broke I have been plagued with a hacking cough, weakness, and nose stoppage.  For a few days I was overdosing on Advil Cold and Sinus and managed to achieve regular breathing again, but I believe that I hit my body with a mega-blast of ibuprofen and caused temporary kidney failure (it felt like it anyway).  Finally, there seems to be no end in sight (except through the power of will), and I have already lost 10 lbs.  I am so freaking tired of being sick that I am on the verge of seppuku.  I think that I have to break down and see a doctor.  Sigh.
