For a limited time, you can order Miscrosoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/unixproresources/freesfu30.asp">Windows Services for UNIX 3.0</a> (~$11.00 shipping).  I'm not sure how yet, but this code was developed in collaboration with SCO and there has to be a way to use it to stick it to them.
