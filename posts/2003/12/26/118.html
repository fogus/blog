<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/26/toddlers.claim.ap/index.html">2-year-old
model and actor who cut his head at a playground is seeking unspecified
lost wages and other compensation from the city.</a> <br /> <br />Quote:
<code>In a letter to officials, she demanded compensation for medical
bills, pain and suffering and a “lost wage amount due to his inability
to audition or take modeling or commercial jobs while his head
heals.”</code> <br /> <br />Further: <code>Mader blamed the boy’s injury
on a green railing, which she said blends in with the landscaping. Mader
said the railing should be painted a brighter color.</code> <br />
<br />Am I unique in that as a child I was constantly pummled by my
local park? There were many times that I was unable to work at my jobs
at the coal mine and sweatshop because of a serious, park-relate,
injury. Did I sue the city? Nooooo! This is another sign of creeping
doom upon the USA. If this boy model and his mother wins their lawsuit,
then I am moving to another country. Nuff said. <br />-m <br /></p>
