Finally made it to Taekwondo training with a bloodstream filled with antibiotics, ibuprofen, guaifenesin, pseudoepedrine, dextromethorphan, and tofu.  I jumped higher, kicked harder, moved quicker, and stretched further than ever.  I'm not sure if this is a result of the toxic waste in my veins, or the 19 days of rest that I was forced to take.
