<p>Yuki got me a Gameboy Advance with Super Mario Brothers 3 included.
It’s been great wasting my days playing that classic. I’ve been
reminiscing on the days of the classic NES 8-bit console, and came up
with a frivolous list of my top 11 favorites from it. <br />
<br /><b>11) Strider</b> <br />Strider was a pretty good arcade game,
but turned out to be much better for the NES. How that happened, I’ll
never know. You are this futuristic dude with a bad-ass Scimitar (no
Drow here), cool hair, and mindless enemy fodder for to slice.

<br /><b>10) RC Pro AM</b> <br />This was a much better game versus a
few friends… Luckily I had a few. On it’s own it doesn’t stand up as
well, but is still a blast.
<br /><img src="./images/rc2.jpg" width=203 height=177> <br />
<br /><b>9) Metroid</b> <br />One of the true classics for the NES. Many
attempts have been made to capture the magic of this the first, but they
have all fallen well short. You are this flipping futuristic chick
(although this fact is not revealed until the end, allowing for the
maximum emasculating effect) that blasts the snot out of many baddies
and doors. <br /><img src="./images/metroid2.jpg" width=203 height=177>
<br /> <br /><b>8) Wizards and Warriors</b> <br />This game ruled. It
was the only one on this list that I was never able to complete.
<br /><img src="./images/waw.gif" width=203 height=177> <br />
<br /><b>7) The Uninvited</b> <br />I remember seeing the commercial for
this game (which rocked BTW) and immediately dropping major coin on it.
It was the best horror game available for any 8-bit platform.
<br /><img src="./images/uninvited.gif" width=203 height=177> <br />
<br /><b>6) Kid Icarus</b> <br />One of the most purely entertaining
games for any platform, ever. When the final quest was beaten, the
entire quest was started anew with the uber-weapons obtained previously…
and it remained infinitely great. I must have run that loop dozens of
times. <br /><img src="./images/icarus.gif" width=203 height=177> <br />
<br /><b>5) Castlevania</b> <br />While technically a horror themed
game, it is not considered by myself to be the best ever (the nod goes
to #7 above) of that genre. Why? It wasn’t scary. However, the gameplay
was beyond compare.
<br /><img src="./images/castleva2.jpg" width=203 height=177> <br />
<br /><b>4) Baseball Stars</b> <br />I grew up playing baseball, so
naturally one should make this list no? It was the first baseball game
that I could recall with a builtin mechanism for editing player
abilities (I figured out how to do it on Hardball for the C64, but it
was a hack).
<br /><img src="./images/basestar.gif" width=203 height=177> <br />
<br /><b>3) Bionic Commando</b> <br />Again, the theme of futuristic
hero took hold of me. You are this German guy (I always imagined so
anyway) with a bionic arm that would fire out (ala Inspector Gadget) and
latch onto things. It was also a great arcade game.
<br /><img src="./images/bcomando2.jpg" width=203 height=177> <br />
<br /><b>2) Super Mario Brothers 2</b> <br />While part 3 started this
whole list, SMB2 is by far the shining star in the family. You can
choose between one of four characters to beat levels, each of which had
unique strengths and weaknesses. I preferred the short, strong guy…
can’t remember his name.
<br /><img src="./images/SMB2-3.gif" width=203 height=177> <br />
<br /><b>1) Dragon Warrior</b> <br />Perhaps one of my top 5 favorite
electronic RPGs for any system (alas, a list for another day). I spent
endless hours building my warrior up only to find that he still was not
strong enough to complete the quest. I then spent endless hours
rebuilding my warrior up to even higher levels to finally beat the game.
Of all the games listed, it is perhaps the only one that I would
willingly spend endless hours on to this day.

<br /><i> Honorable mentions: Metal Gear (the first strategy based
shoot-em-up game that I played), Mike Tyson’s Punchout (it was just
fun), Final Fantasy (another great RPG, but much better on other
systems), Karnov (you are a fire spitting circus freak), Legend of Kage
(was Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon before CTHD was), Tecmo Bowl (Bo
Jackson was unstoppable), Tetris (simple, yet compelling), Zelda 1 and 2
(world-building at its best), Excite Bike (I liked making my own
tracks), Ninja Gaiden (hot ninja action), Dusty Diamond’s All-Star
Softball (I think that I owned the only copy, but I wore it the hell
out).</i> <br /> <br />-m <br /></p>
