Just got this LSDJ related email:
<br /><code>
<br />  &nbsp;Hi there,
<br />
<br />  &nbsp;I wanted to announce that I am selling out the last few Little Sound Dj 
<br />  &nbsp;cartridges I got for $799 a piece.
<br />
<br />  &nbsp;This is seriously a ripoff, but if there is anyone out there who thinks 
<br />  &nbsp;you have way too much money, feel free to go ahead and spend it. First 
<br />  &nbsp;come, first serve.
<br />
<br />  &nbsp;No more production is planned, so this might be the last chance to get 
<br />  &nbsp;this piece of software in cartridge form.
<br />
<br />  &nbsp;Regards,
<br />  &nbsp;Johan

<br />I have been looking for one of these bad boys for a long time, but at $799 a pop I think I will have to pass.
