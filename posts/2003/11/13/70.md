<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,61181,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_4">Wired News: E-Mail From the Great Beyond</a>: "Some people can't live without e-mail -- and, apparently, some people can't die without it. Fortunately for those in the latter group, there's mylastemail.com, a new service that promises to deliver your final, heartfelt e-mail messages to your friends and relatives once you have passed on to that big cubicle in the sky. Launched Monday by Tampa, Florida-based LifeTouch, the service lets customers store up to five messages on the company's server until they die. At that time, a customer's friend, relative or colleague mails a release certificate to LifeTouch, which then initiates the delivery of the messages."
