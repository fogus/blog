I feel like complete death.  I appear to have a fever, but its actual stats have not been measured.  While it certainly sucks to be sick, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.  That is, I read quite a few blogs during a typical day, and starting last week I noticed an increasing trend in the number of "I am sick" blog entries.  Noticing this trend, I should have taken the time to take better care of myself.  It would have been no problem to eat a few oranges, wear the hat that Yuki made for me (more often), and avoid human contact.  The Blog phenomena is a powerful device.  Perhaps one can use it to not only keep track of the current memes, but to also predict plagues and other natural disasters?
