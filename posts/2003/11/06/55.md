<i>The Splits Review #2</i>
<br />Front Right: 8" from ground
<br />Front Left: 8" from ground
<br />Side Split: 15" from ground
<br />
<br />I managed to gain an inch on the right and three inches in the middle.  I was told by my instructor that 3-inches in two weeks was awesome, but it still seems like I'm a mile away from the ground.  I have noticed that my side kicks have gotten disproportionately higher than my gain in static splits.  Perhaps the method that I'm using is more ballistic than I initially thought...  I'll have to talk to Master Kevin about that.
