Could a signal from the stars broadcast by an alien intelligence also carry harmful information, in the spirit of a computer virus? Could star folk launch a 'disinformation' campaign -- one that covers up aspects of their culture? Perhaps they might even mask the 'real' intent of dispatching a message to other civilizations scattered throughout the Cosmos. These are concerns that deserve attention explains Richard Carrigan, Jr., a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. Those engaged in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), he contends, should think about decontaminating potential SETI signals."
