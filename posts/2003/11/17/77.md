<a href="http://www.chessbase.com/games/2003/kasparovx3dfritzgame3.htm">Chess News, Chess Programs, Databases - Play Chess Online</a>: "Just in case you thought the rise of the machines was inevitable, Garry Kasparov stood up for humanity in game three against X3D Fritz in New York City. Actually, it was more a case of X3D Fritz lying down while Kasparov rolled over it like he was the Terminator instead of the human. The match is now tied 1.5-1.5. The final game is Tuesday and X3D Fritz will have white."
