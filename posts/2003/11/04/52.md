<a href="http://www.bresink.de/osx/NFSManager.html">MBS: NFS Manager</a>: "NFS Manager is a small tool for easy access to the NFS features of Mac OS X. As an operating system with a Unix core, Mac OS X is able to support the Network File System (NFS) protocol. NFS is the accepted industry standard for sharing files between Unix systems. Although NFS is a built-in component of Mac OS X, users cannot access this feature without special knowledge and use of the command-line. NFS Manager solves this problem by providing an easy-to-use Aqua interface for the definition of NFS connections."

<br />This is a great NFS tool for OSX.  I personally hate setting up NFS via the command line, so this was a lifesaver for me.  Version 2.5 works with panther.
