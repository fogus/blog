<a href="http://www.winfieldcourier.com/w031115/Thurs2.html">Attorney looking at Geuda gun law</a>: "The law would require that all homes within the community be equipped with a gun. The ordinance states that, <i>In order to provide for emergency management of the city, every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition.</i>"

<br />Interesting approach to the gun issue, and quite frankly one that I have yet to see.  Someone, somewhere is going to freak out about this.  The national news coverage so far on this issue has been nil, but maybe I've mistakenly thought it as original.  Does this happen all of the time?
