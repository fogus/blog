<a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5107201.html">News: Sun bets on free Java tool</a>: "Sun Microsystems will release a free version of its Java application server next week, a move designed to encourage more developers to build programs on the software foundation."

<br />This is good news.  I've used this in the past through my company and it was pretty sweet.  The same disclaimer applies to using Sun products as always.  Although this is a great system, one should be wary of relying too heavily on a company that is experiencing an identity crisis.
