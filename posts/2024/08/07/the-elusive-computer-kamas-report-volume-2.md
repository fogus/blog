The [Internet Archive currently has digital copies of almost every KAMAS Report](https://archive.org/search?query=subject%3A%22kamas%22&and%5B%5D=mediatype%3A%22texts%22), except for vol 2. KAMAS was (is?) early outliner software originally written for the Kaypro line of computers running CP/M. I previously wrote about KAMAS in my [8-bit Spirituals post](https://blog.fogus.me/2020/05/20/8-bit-spirituals/) and have looked for vol. 2 ever since to no avail. If anyone has a copy (digital or physical) then please reach out at ![me at fogus dot me](https://www.fogus.me/images/addy.png).

Thanks!
