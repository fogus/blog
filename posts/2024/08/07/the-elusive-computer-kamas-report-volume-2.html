<p>The <a
href="https://archive.org/search?query=subject%3A%22kamas%22&amp;and%5B%5D=mediatype%3A%22texts%22">Internet
Archive currently has digital copies of almost every KAMAS Report</a>,
except for vol 2. KAMAS was (is?) early outliner software originally
written for the Kaypro line of computers running CP/M. I previously
wrote about KAMAS in my <a
href="https://blog.fogus.me/2020/05/20/8-bit-spirituals/">8-bit
Spirituals post</a> and have looked for vol.Â 2 ever since to no avail.
If anyone has a copy (digital or physical) then please reach out at <img

<p>Thanks!</p>
