<p>Prior to <a
href="https://blog.fogus.me/2007/10/24/linkage-20071024/">discovering
Clojure back in 2007</a>, I was a full-time Java programmer. This was
long before method handles, method references, lambda expressions, and
invokedynamic, so viewing Java through a functional programming lens was
not second-nature to me. Regardless, during my early Clojure
explorations I fully expected code like the following to “just
work”:</p>
<pre><code>(defn up-all [strings]
  (map .toUpperCase strings))
;; Unable to resolve symbol: .toUpperCase</code></pre>
<p>That is, I<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> fully expected Clojure to recognize
that <code>.toUpperCase</code> referred to the instance method
<code>String.toUpperCase</code> as a value, and infer how to “do the
right thing” with it for each element in the <code>strings</code>
collection handled by <code>map</code> even though Clojure could never
know what it might hold.</p>
<p>Of course, it eventually occurred to me that the actual way to do
what I wanted was to wrap the method call in a function instead:</p>
<pre><code>(defn up-all [strings]
  (map (fn [s] (.toUpperCase s)) strings))

(up-all [&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;])
;;=&gt; [&quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Once I learned of this fact, I put it into my tool-belt and moved on.
But I could have asked the question of why it didn’t work as I expected
and even at that early time I think that Clojure could have supported
it… almost.</p>

<h2 id="why-method-values">Why Method Values</h2>
<p>Adding features to a programming language is not a casual process.
New features need to first solve a problem and second need to fit within
the gestalt of the language. Sometimes problems are aesthetic, sometimes
they address complexities or common mistakes, and sometimes they address
bugs. As I showed, the lack of method values wasn’t a bug in Clojure
because there was an idiomatic and straight-forward way to wrap method
calls with functions. Aesthetically, writing <code>.toUpperCase</code>
is certainly fewer characters than <code>#(.toUpperCase %)</code> and is
arguably cleaner, but few Clojure programmers were clamoring for the
reduction of 4 characters in such cases. Instead, the problems that
method value solve fall into the complexities category.</p>
<p>Clojure provides a hinting syntax that adds metadata to applicable
syntactic elements that signify their types. If you fail to use hinting
in cases where type information will help resolve ambiguity then your
program can run slower.</p>
<h3 id="incidental-reflection">Incidental reflection</h3>
<p>The function example above is flawed in a way that becomes evident
with the addition of a line of code:</p>
<pre><code>(set! *warn-on-reflection* true)

(defn up-all [strings]
  (map (fn [s] (.toUpperCase s)) strings))
;; REFLECTION WARNING

(up-all [&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;])
;;=&gt; [&quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that Clojure cannot resolve which class the
<code>.toUpperCase</code> method belongs to until using reflection at
run time to determine the type of its argument. Reflection is a
wonderful tool for <a
href="https://blog.fogus.me/2022/11/10/the-one-about-lisp-interactivity/">interactive
programming</a> but it’s slower than direct invocation that you get with
resolved methods using type hints:</p>
<pre><code>(map (fn [s] (.toUpperCase ^String s)) [&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;])
;;=&gt; [&quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot;]</code></pre>
<h3 id="loss-of-type-generality">Loss of type generality</h3>
<p>Manual hinting is a fine way to help Clojure resolve method contexts,
but using type hinting reduces the generality of a function. This
becomes more clear with the following example:</p>
<pre><code>(defn absv [^long n] (Math/abs n))

(map absv [-1 -2 3])
;;=&gt; [1 2 3]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>absv</code> function<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> works fine for longs,
but does not generalize to doubles because of the manual hinting:</p>
<pre><code>(map absv [-1.1 -2.45 3.14159])
;;=&gt; [1 2 3]</code></pre>
<h3 id="loss-of-arity-generality">Loss of arity generality</h3>
<p>The function <code>(fn [s] (.toUpperCase ^String s))</code> works
fine for single strings, but the <code>.toUpperCase</code> method is
overloaded on arity allowing an additional <code>java.util.Locale</code>
object argument. The function taking a single argument <code>s</code>
would clearly not work for users wishing to call the 2-arity case.</p>
<p>Any method value implementation should work to solve the complexities
listed, and since the manual solution involved function wrapping, we
decided that method values should become Clojure functions that call the
named method. The specifics of the generated functions were iterated on,
but the general idea was that the function arities would correspond to
the arities of the method. However, we decided very early on that
Clojure should support method value syntax not only in value position,
but also in invocation position.</p>
<h2 id="qualified-methods-in-invocation-position">Qualified methods in
invocation position</h2>
<p>Prior to Clojure 1.12.0, Java interop calls in invocation position
took one of three forms: <code>Classname/staticMethod</code>,
<code>.instanceMethod</code>, or <code>Classname.</code> for
constructors. There are problems with re-purposing the existing
invocation syntaxes for value position. First, value position method
values are by nature context agnostic, therefore deriving an instance
method’s target type is impossible without some additional information
available only at runtime. Second, the three syntaxes are asymmetric in
their form. Finally, as a technical point the syntaxes were sugar that
Clojure translated into various configurations of the <code>.</code> and
<code>new</code> special forms. Any new syntax had to address all three
of these considerations.</p>
<p>Therefore, we moved to what we called “qualified methods”, which is
an expansion of the existing static method symbolic form to both
instance methods and constructors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Classname/staticMethod</code></li>
<li><code>Classname/.instanceMethod</code></li>
<li><code>Classname/new</code> for constructors</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, Clojure already knew how to resolve class names in
symbol prefixes, so moving to this cleaner syntax allowed us to leverage
existing code-paths. This allowed us to double down on providing strong
feature semantics using existing support. Additionally, having the
prefix class in hand for all three cases allows Clojure to use it as
essential method resolution contexts, even in invocations:</p>
<pre><code>(map (fn [s] (String/.toUpperCase s)) [&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;])
;;=&gt; [&quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>The implications for supporting qualified methods naturally led to an
elegant implementation approach that I’ll discuss in the next post. But
for now it’s worth noting that by moving to this syntax for instance
methods required some extra consideration. That is, circumstances can
arise where the qualifying class in a qualified instance method call can
contradict the type of the target object, for example:</p>
<pre><code>(map (fn [s] (String/.toUpperCase ^Object s)) [&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;])
;;=&gt; [&quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>For qualified instance method calls, it made sense to always use the
qualifying class for the purpose of resolving the instance method to
invoke.</p>
<h2 id="qualified-methods-in-value-position">Qualified methods in value
position</h2>
<p>Of course, because qualified methods contain the context class for
the method we can leverage that information to resolve methods in
otherwise context-free value positions. However, there are deeper
complexities in play that further complicate resolution in value
position that I’ll discuss presently.</p>
<h3 id="method-value-resolution">Method value resolution</h3>
<p>The different ways to refer to the instance method
<code>Double/.isNaN</code> and the static method
<code>Double/isNaN</code> eliminate the first layer of ambiguity.
However, a bigger problem is how to resolve type-overloaded methods like
<code>Math/abs</code> that take any of primitive doubles, floats, ints,
or longs? The obvious solution was to somehow attach signature
information to the method value itself like <code>Math/abs-long</code>.
However, this approach is not conducive to programmatic generation
(i.e. in macros) as it requires symbolic munging and deconstruction by
every programmer who wants to deal with method values. Instead, Clojure
already has an elegant and programmer-friendly way to attach information
to forms, namely via metadata.</p>
<h4 id="explicit-resolution">Explicit resolution</h4>
<p>We already saw how to use type hints to resolve the
<code>.toUpperCase</code> method. So it felt natural to add a new kind
of metadata to help resolve method values. That is, any qualified method
with a metadata mapping of the keyword <code>:param-tags</code> to a
vector of zero or more legal type hints will signal to Clojure the
desired overload and arity of the method to use in the generated
function call. We added a shorthand for this metadata using a new
metadata syntax <code>^[... tag hints ...]</code> for it:</p>
<pre><code>^[long] Math/abs
;; resolves to only the static method taking 1 primitive long</code></pre>
<p>This is analogous to the <code>:tag</code> metadata, and any legal
<code>:tag</code> value is legal inside of the param-tags vector.
Further, we also allow the special hint <code>_</code> in the param-tags
vector that signals a kind of “any type” in that place of the signature.
Further, the param-tag metadata provides arity declaration by default.
These capabilities allow programmers to param-tags to convey their
intent for a specific arity and the minimum types to resolve to a single
method signature. Opting into this intentional specification means that
any existing ambiguity is an error condition.</p>
<h4 id="inference">Inference</h4>
<p>As you might guess, sometimes NO param-tags might be enough to
disambiguate a method if there are no type nor arity overloads at all.
For example, the method <code>java.time.OffsetDateTime/.getYear</code>
is not overloaded at all and therefore resolves without the use of
param-tags at all. Sadly our old friend <code>Math/abs</code> is
overloaded and therefore requires param-tags to resolve. However, I
showed that Clojure already allows the use of unresolved methods by
falling back to reflection at run time and therefore it felt natural to
do the same for unresolved qualified methods without param-tags.</p>
<p>However, Clojure has always used surrounding context to help resolve
interop calls. We realized that qualified method invocations could
leverage not only their qualifying class for resolution context, but
also the mechanisms for leveraging type flow to resolve type overloads.
Take the following example:</p>
<pre><code>(defn bat-file? [filename &amp; {loc :loc}]
  (let [ext &quot;bat&quot;
        fnm (if loc 
              (String/.toLowerCase filename loc)
              (String/.toLowerCase filename))]
    (String/.endsWith fnm ext)))

(bat-file? &quot;AUTOEXEC.BAT&quot;)
;;=&gt; true</code></pre>
<p>The <code>bat-file?</code> function uses both qualifying class
information and also type flow information to resolve the method calls
within:</p>
<ul>
<li>The qualifying context is inherent in the qualified
<code>String/.toLowerCase</code> calls</li>
<li><code>String/.toLowerCase</code> is arity overloaded, but not type
overloaded at each arity, so there is no ambiguity</li>
<li><code>ext</code> is bound to a string literal that Clojure
recognizes and uses as its type</li>
</ul>
<p>While, the calls above all resolve, there may be circumstances where
type flow is insufficient to resolve even a qualified method call. In
those cases Clojure falls back to reflective calls at run time. As I
mentioned before, reflection is a tool supporting <a
href="https://blog.fogus.me/2022/11/10/the-one-about-lisp-interactivity/">interactive
programming</a>, which itself is a differentiating feature of Lisp
languages in general. It was critical that qualified methods in both
invocation and value position fall back to reflection on non-resolution
to preserve interactivity. And of course, falling back to reflection
does not preclude programmers from also using param-tags to guaranteed
non-reflective cases in production-ready code.</p>
<h4 id="the-method-value-razor">The method value razor</h4>
<p>By splitting method value resolution into explicit and inferential
branches, we’ve provided users with complimentary options. With
param-tags Clojure programmers can intentionally specifiy which method
that they want and if Clojure can resolve it then they’re bound to the
resolved method now and forever.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> On the other hand,
programmers can forego param-tags and Clojure will derive intention at
compile time or at runtime via reflection.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Implementing method values for Clojure 1.12.0 was an incremental
process that incorporated a thoughtful design process coupled with
thoughtful feedback from the community. As a result I believe that we
have added a feature to Clojure that’s elegant in approach and in
implementation (a topic for a future post). If you’re interested in
