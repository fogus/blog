Starting in the late-1960s/early-1970s Elsevier and McDonald teamed up to print a series of computing books under the series “[Computer Monographs](https://www.librarything.com/nseries/81668/Computer-Monographs)”. I’ve read a couple and they were both well-written and likely ahead of their time. While looking deeper into the series I learned that 26 volumes in the series were printed, however I cannot seem to find any information nor mention of an 11th volume. Researching information about the series in general has been a challenge so it’s unclear why there seems to be no data about #11 — be it simply lack of data or if there really is a gap in the series. In any case, I shall not sleep until I figure this out!

:F
