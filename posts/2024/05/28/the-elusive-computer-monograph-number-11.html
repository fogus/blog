<p>Starting in the late-1960s/early-1970s Elsevier and McDonald teamed
up to print a series of computing books under the series “<a
href="https://www.librarything.com/nseries/81668/Computer-Monographs">Computer
Monographs</a>”. I’ve read a couple and they were both well-written and
likely ahead of their time. While looking deeper into the series I
learned that 26 volumes in the series were printed, however I cannot
seem to find any information nor mention of an 11th volume. Researching
information about the series in general has been a challenge so it’s
unclear why there seems to be no data about #11 — be it simply lack of
data or if there really is a gap in the series. In any case, I shall not
sleep until I figure this out!</p>
