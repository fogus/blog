<p>For a while I considered the possibility of attending <a
href="http://clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West 2016</a>, but frankly I’d
grown tired of technical conferences. At one point in my life I loved
every moment of every conference that I’d ever attended, but over time
I’ve grown tired of the whole experience. First, I’m quite shy by nature
and have never felt terribly comfortable putting myself out there and
engaging in the typical hallway and post-conference festival of
affectations. I’ve always felt more at home with a small gathering of
friends and so I didn’t really consider going to the conference this
year. However, I’d never visited Seattle before, so I decided that I
would take a few days to go with my family and explore the city during
the after-conference hours. This exploration of that beautiful city was
spectacular, but it was during the conference hours that I found myself
pleasantly surprised.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>The first talk of the conference was “<em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTCy_DkAJGk">Specter: Powerful and
Simple Data Structure Manipulation</a></em>” by <a
href="https://twitter.com/nathanmarz">Nathan Marz</a>. <a
href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter">Specter</a> is a library
that provides fast path-based data access and transformation utilities.
I’ve not had the privilege to dig deep into it, but it seems like an
impressive piece of engineering. That is, while the basic concept takes
40 lines of code to implement, the real challenge is making the concept
fast, which Nathan was able to do. I can’t wait to really try it out.
That said, I want to make a quick point. The library is billed as
“Clojure’s missing feature” and numerous times in conversation with
others the point was made that they’d love to see Specter integrated
into Clojure’s core. While I can see the justification for this
sentiment, one of the reasons that we use a Lisp is that <strong>we
don’t need Specter in core</strong> – it works perfectly well as a
library. Indeed, the beauty of Lisp is such that libraries are fully
privileged with regard to any other language construct (save for special
forms), including those found in the core. Therefore, my rebuttal is
that Lisp in general and Clojure in particular enables the perspective:
more libraries / less core.</p>
<p>Every conference needs at least one case-study and “<em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUC7noGU1mQ">Managing One of the
World’s Largest Clojure Code Bases</a></em>” by Donevan Dolby was a
pretty good one. He discussed some of the sticking points around
managing a large codebase (~16K LoC) all of which are true and real and
I encourage you to watch the video for the precise details. The most
interesting part of the talk for me however was the mention that Clojure
is on Boeing’s list of approved languages. That was a nice surprise.</p>
<p>One of my favorite talks of the conference was “<em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO67QNn9hPY">Creating DSLs - A
tale of spec-tacular success and failure</a></em>” by <a
href="https://twitter.com/chckadee">Claire Alvis</a>. In the
presentation Claire talks about a library named <a
href="https://github.com/SparkFund/spec-tacular">spec-tacular</a> that
she and her company <a href="https://www.sparkfund.co/">SparkFund</a>
created that adds some static and run-time guarantees to their <a
href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a> database access via some
hardcore macrology. The most interesting thing about the talk was that
Claire took time to define the characteristics of a good Clojure (though
the criteria applies generally) library and then graded spec-tacular
against them. Some characteristics were successfully met while others
were not, but the real take-away from the talk was that she’s clearly
thought long and hard about this topic and even still her library only
partially meets the criteria. This really drives home the fact that
while we may have idealized models of “good software” the realities of
production needs often impinge on them in unexpected ways due to very
real trade-offs. I traditionally despise “library talks” because they
very seldom discuss the trade-offs involved in the development and use
of said library, but Claire’s was a breath of fresh air. Spec-tacular is
not an idealized library, but it solves a very real problem for
SparkFund in a very specific way and Claire did a masterful job of
highlighting the trade-offs inherent in its construction.</p>
<p>After lunch I attended a <a
href="http://www.cognitect.com">Cognitect</a> Q&amp;A in the
anticipation that I might have something to contribute (I was wrong).
There were a lot of good discussion around the practical use of Datomic
and if you’re interested in using it then it’s a good video to check
out.</p>
<h3 id="diversity">Diversity</h3>
<p>“<em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjIUyUFOHhA">ClojureBridge in
Practice</a></em>” by <a href="https://twitter.com/kf">Katherine
Fellows</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaPawlicka">Anna
Pawlicka</a> was the first talk in a series of similarly themed talks
around community growth and diversification. Let’s be honest, the
diversity numbers in the Clojure community are not great. I hesitate to
posit why this is the case, but I can say that there are many people<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> putting a lot of effort into
diversifying the current stark homogenous makeup of the community.
There’s still a lot of work to do to build a community that can foster
the creativity of people of varying perspectives, but things are better
than they’ve ever been and look to continue along a positive trajectory.
<strong>This is a great thing.</strong> Both <a
href="http://www.twitter.com/puredanger">Alex Miller</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/lynngrogan">Lynn Grogan</a>, the organizers of
the conference, have worked tirelessly to ensure a wider representation
of people across all demographics, including people with very diverse
backgrounds, both cultural and professional. <a
href="http://www.clojurebridge.org/">ClojureBridge</a> is an amazing
effort and absolutely an essential part of the Clojure ecosystem.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, another of my favorite talks of the conference was
“<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOIhncWcCjA">Deepen and
Diversify the Clojure Community with Jr Engineers</a></em>” by <a
href="https://twitter.com/amiekuttruff">Amie Kuttruff</a>. In the talk
she told anecdotes about her experience as a “junior engineer” and her
growth as a Clojure programmer fostered by thoughtful mentorship. She
made a fantastic point about the fact that very often what makes
learning so difficult is that people come to a new topic without even a
basic context needed to begin exploration. I can only speak for myself
when I say that I sometimes forget what it was like to not know how to
program. But looking back on the beginning, there were many times when I
knew so little about the topic that I didn’t have the basic contextual
vocabulary[^context] to even formulate questions. This is a
bootstrapping problem that’s particularly pernicious in programming
because from the outside it seems incredibly difficult and ponderously
mathematical and appears to move fast and on top of all of that is
collectively impatient (or downright repellent to) with people from
non-technical backgrounds. This is incredibly intimidating. It takes
patient and thoughtful mentorship to effectively guide people to become
not only effective learners but also invaluable members of a programming
community and workplace. There are many people in the world who’re drawn
to programming for any number of personal reasons and we as a
programming community would do well to tap into that interest to help
grow and enable others to benefit, and benefit from, our industry.</p>
