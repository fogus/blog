* *[Alan Kay's comments on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=alankay1)* - *Yes.  Alan Kay occasionally posts on Hacker News.*
* *[The glorious horror of TECO](http://goodmath.scientopia.org/2010/11/30/the-glorious-horror-of-teco/)* - *Any program as influential as TECO and described as a "glorious horror" is worth at least checking out for a hot-second.*

* *[Contempt culture](http://blog.aurynn.com/contempt-culture)* - *People in general are haters.  However, when paychecks are involved then all sense of decorum in online discussions revolving around tech fly right out the window.  Tech is not a meritocracy but instead a culture of contempt whereby "merit" is defined in terms of arbitrary, inconsistent, and fleeting Venn diagrams.*
