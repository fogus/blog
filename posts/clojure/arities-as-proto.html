<h1 id="arities-as-pseudo-protocol">Arities as pseudo-protocol</h1>
<p>Recently the Clojure team released an alpha version of the core.async
library that includes a new library named <a
href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/flow-guide.html">Flow</a>.
While the new functionality is amazing and is already inspiring devs to
use it, this post is not about Flow. Instead, I’d like to talk about a
small part of the Flow API where process behavior is implemented in
terms of <a
href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/flow-guide.html">step-fns</a>.
Simply put, step-fns are functions of four arities, where each arity is
called at key points in the life-cycle of a process to provide
configuration information or perform behaviors.</p>
<p>The four arities are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 Describe the step-fn by returning a data-structure describing its
boundaries</li>
<li>1 Returns the initialization state for the enclosing process given
compatible arguments</li>
<li>2 Called every time a life-cycle transition occurs with a state and
transition key and returns an updated state</li>
<li>3 Called in a loop for every message received by the enclosing
process with a state, input, and message and returns a tuple of the
transformed state and a map o receivers -&gt; messages</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a
href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/flow-guide.html">official
Flow guide</a>.</p>
<p>Long-time Clojure programmers will immediately wonder why the
function arity approach is used in lieu of a protocol such as the
following:</p>
<pre><code>(defprotocol StepFn
  (describe [_])
  (init [_ arg-map])
  (transition [_ state trans])
  (transform [_ state input msg]))</code></pre>
<p>Clojure devs are accustomed to defining protocols for just such
occasions, and indeed a protocol would have worked for step-fns also. As
always, there are trade-offs for choosing one approach over another, so
I’ll talk about that. But first, I would like to invite the reader to
squint their eyes a bit and see the lines between the two blur.</p>
<h2 id="bags-of-names-and-bags-of-numbers">Bags of names and bags of
numbers</h2>
<p>The protocol <code>StepFn</code> above defined a set of functions.
Each function in the set defines two things that define how a protocol
dispatches on its target: name + arity. On the other hand, a function
alone defines a set of arities alone. That is, Clojure dispatches to the
function body associated with the arity corresponding to the arguments
count. These are different, but are similar in ways that choosing a
protocol over function arities is worth some careful consideration.</p>
<p>Rather than outlining the motivations for using protocols, I’ll defer
to the <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/protocols">existing
protocols documentation</a> as a guide. Instead, I’d like to talk about
the benefits of using an arity pseudo-protocol.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-arity-dispatch">Benefits of arity dispatch</h2>
<p>To avoid burying the lede, let me just enumerate the primary benefits
of leveraging function arity in a Clojure API:</p>
<ul>
<li>fn-punning</li>
<li>Hot reloading</li>
<li>Good names</li>
<li>Composition</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Lisp programmer, I value <a
href="https://blog.fogus.me/2022/11/10/the-one-about-lisp-interactivity.html">interactivity</a>
in my development process very highly in my hierarchy of developer
needs. Flow facilitates interactivity by leveraging <a
href="https://clojure.org/reference/vars">Var</a> Var fn-punning. A Var
is a reference to a value within a context – usually a namespace. If the
value held in the Var is a function, then we can call the Var itself as
a function and it will delegate the call down to the function that it
holds. This is one form of fn-punning in Clojure. The benefit of this
form is that we can use the Var as a stand-in for a step-fn in flow and
if we later redefine the function that the Var holds then the process
calling it will automatically get the new behavior. Another practical
benefit is that when errors occur we will get better names in the error
output if Vars are used instead of functions. Certainly the message
<code>Execution error (ArithmeticException) at user/flub</code> looks
much better than
<code>Execution error (ArithmeticException) at user/eval141$fn</code>.
Finally, while it’s not likely to be a major win for step-fns in Flow,
function composition allows users to augment behaviors in ad hoc
ways.</p>
<h2 id="downsides-of-arity-dispatch">Downsides of arity dispatch</h2>
<p>Aside from the fact that leveraging arity dispatch is an under
utilized technique,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> there is one big downside of using
that technique. That is, because a function only defines its dispatch on
a set of numbers (arities), if you ever need more functionality that
clashes with an existing arity then you’re in the soup. Additionally, by
attaching expected behavior to arities, you lose the descriptive benefit
that the names in a protocol provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Familiarity is half of popularity</p>
<p>– Alison Frane</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with anything in programming, choosing one approach over another
requires an analysis of the trade-offs. Both protocol dispatch and arity
dispatch are tools with upsides and downsides and while the former
covers many cases that the latter does, there are some compelling
reasons to choose a function instead.</p>
