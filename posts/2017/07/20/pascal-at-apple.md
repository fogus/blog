Lately I've been reading old computing papers, articles, journals, magazines, and memos and tweeting about them as I work my way through.  The most recent exploration was of an Apple internal memo about the history of Apple's involvement with Pascal.  The memo is cursory, but it does provide an interesting snapshot of the history of Pascal within the company.

Above you'll find a Tweet thread that spurred this post.
