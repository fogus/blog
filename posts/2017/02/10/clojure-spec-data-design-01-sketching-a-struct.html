<p>With the growing focus on functional programming the importance of
data design has been thrust to the forefront. That said, you wouldn’t
know that the importance was widely agreed upon based on an observation
of existing data-driven APIs. Certainly I’ve committed my share of sins
in the name of “API data packets,” but with the release of <em>Spec</em>
I’ve come to approach the matter of data design in a more systematic
way. In this quick post I’ll talk briefly about the first step that I
like to call “sketching a struct” that I suspect many programmers do to
some extent, but one that I believe is enhanced in the presence of <a
href="https://clojure.org/about/spec">clojure.spec</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sketching-a-struct">Sketching a Struct</h2>
<p>The act of sketching a struct is not magical. Whether you’re
designing an object graph, JSON packet, or Clojure map the point is
generally the same: just type out<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> what the data structure
should look like. Imagine that you’re interested in designing the
representation for the runtime <em>state</em> of a game that you’re
creating. The game consists of pieces of varying <em>sizes</em> and
<em>capability</em>, each of which can reside at a certain location
called a <em>system</em> either as a <em>ship</em> or a <em>star</em>.
Each player controls a single system containing two stars called a
<em><a
href="http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds">homeworld</a></em>.
This bare skeleton is probably enough to sketch out a structure to
represent the state for this fictional game.</p>
<p>When sketching a struct I tend to work top-down until I have
something that works for me and then switch to a bottom-up approach when
implementing specs and helper functions. Therefore, sketching top-down
means starting with the high-level game state, structured as a Clojure
map:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
{:game/players    [{:player/name "Mike" 
                    :player/seat :seat/north}, 
                   {:player/name "Russ" 
                    :player/seat :seat/south}]
 :game/turn       0
 :game/systems    {:??? :???}
 :game/homeworlds {:seat/north :??? :seat/south :???}}
</pre>
<p>When sketching a struct I like to fill out the data with something
representational, but there are times when I don’t quite know what I’m
after, so instead of wasting time trying to come up with the perfect
representation I just move on and put a placeholder keyword
<code>:???</code> or perhaps empty structure literals wherever I need
them. So you’ll notice that I’ve decided to prefix my keywords in the
sketch above. In my early days of writing Clojure I probably would have
used flat keys like <code>:players</code> or <code>:systems</code> but
over time I’ve grown to appreciate the organizational utility of
namespaced keys. With the introduction of <em>Spec</em> I’ve taken to
always using namespaced keys for domain-level concerns<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and
flat keys for local (e.g. function kwargs or Record keys) concerns.
Regarding the use of the vector for the <code>:game/players</code> value
my thinking was that its nature as a sequential structure could be
leveraged<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> for the encoding of the
<code>:game/turn</code> value. In general, when designing a domain
structure in Clojure I find it useful to leverage<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> the
fundamental characteristics of the data types used when they’re
appropriate for encoding essential domain information. Note that the use
of <code>:seat/north</code> and <code>:seat/south</code> can be thought
of as representing enumerations in the system. Finally, by embedding the
player representation in the state structure I’ve got a good idea of its
essential nature, but as sketches go it may need adjustment later
on.</p>
<p>Moving down to the next relevant sub-structure in the state, I might
represent the system structure as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
{:system/name  :name
 :system/stars [:???]
 :system/ships {:ships/north [:???], 
                :ships/south [:???]}}
</pre>
<p>The layout seems reasonable, but I’m not quite sure how to represent
the stars and ships residing in the system. The game is such that the
same pieces are used to represent both and there is a good chance that
any given system will have pieces of the same size and capability. This
seems like a nice segue into the piece structure:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
{:piece/action :action/build
 :piece/size   1}
</pre>
<p>There are two important characteristics os a piece: its capability
(i.e. action) and its size. The size could have been an enumeration such
as <code>:size/small</code>, but a number works just as well. When
dealing with homogenous data elements like the piece structure I prefer
to organize the data such that they’re categorized by their residence in
the host structure rather than using something like an embedded tag.
Anyway, now that I have a useable piece structure I can start filling in
a little more detail:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
{:game/players    [{:player/name "Mike" 
                    :player/seat :seat/north}, 
                   {:player/name "Russ" 
                    :player/seat :seat/south}]
 :game/turn       0
 :game/systems    
  {:name {:system/name  :name
          :system/stars [{:piece/action :action/move 
                          :piece/size 1}]
          :system/ships {:ships/north 
                          [{:piece/action :action/build 
                            :piece/size 1}], 
          :ships/south []}}}
 :game/homeworlds 
  {:seat/north 
    {:system/name  :north
     :system/stars [{:piece/action :action/trade 
                     :piece/size 2}
                    {:piece/action :action/move 
                     :piece/size 3}]
     :system/ships {:ships/north 
                     [{:piece/action :action/build 
                       :piece/size 3}], 
                    :ships/south []}} 
   :seat/south 
    {:system/name  :south
     :system/stars [{:piece/action :action/attack 
                     :piece/size 2}
                    {:piece/action :action/trade 
                     :piece/size 1}]
     :system/ships {:ships/north [], 
                    :ships/south 
                      [{:piece/action :action/move 
                        :piece/size 3}]}}}}
</pre>
<p>Is this the best possible structure? Maybe or maybe not. The point at
this stage is not to devise the perfect structure but instead to use the
data representation as a tool for thinking about the larger problem at
hand. A nice side effect is that at this point I have a useable
structure to begin writing a little code. However, in the past the code
that I’d write would be of the nature of utility functions and
validators. However, with the advent of <em>Spec</em> my entire thought
process changed – and I’ll talk about how in the next post.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>While Lisp programmers have long know the utility of
sketching their structs, I’m convinced that one of the primary reasons
that JSON has taken over the world is that it provides JS-direct
syntactic literals that can be easy typed up and manipulated with little
fuss. JSON is a perfectly adequate tool for sketching for many
programmers.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>I could have also flattened the structure to have
independent keys <code>:player/north</code> and
<code>:player/south</code> instead, but the use of namespace keys
fosters the idea of keeping similar concerns at the same logical level
within a structure. However, there is nothing preventing a flatter state
structure in Clojure and my structure above is a matter of personal
aesthetics.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
