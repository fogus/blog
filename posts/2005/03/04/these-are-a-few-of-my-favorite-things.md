<b>Emulation</b><br /><i>Amiga Computers</i>: <a href="http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/">UAE</a><br />UAE is a mostly complete software emulation of the hardware of the Commodore Amiga 500/1000/2000.<br /><br /><i>Commodore Computers</i>: <a href="http://www.viceteam.org/">VICE</a><br />The current version emulates the C64, the C128, the VIC20, all the PET models (except the SuperPET 9000, which is out of line anyway), the PLUS4 and the CBM-II (aka C610).<br /><br /><i>Macintosh</i>: <a href="http://www.students.uni-mainz.de/bauec002/B2Main.html">Basilisk II</a><br /> Basilisk II is an Open Source 68k Macintosh emulator. That is, it allows you to run 68k MacOS software on your computer, even if you are using a different operating system.<br /><br /><b>Free OSes</b><br /><i>6502-Based</i>: <a href="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/osa/index.html">GeckOS/A65 Operating System</a><br />OS/A65 is a full-featured Multitasking/Multithreading operating system for the 6502. It is preemptive and implements some Unix-like features, like signals, semaphores, relocatable fileformat, standard library, internet support via a kind of simplified sockets and last but not least virtual consoles.<br /><br /><i>Educational</i>: <a href="http://geekos.sourceforge.net">GeekOS</a><br /> GeekOS is in a very early stage of development, so don't expect it to do anything useful.  However, if you're interested in operating systems development and are looking for a simple OS kernel to experiment with, GeekOS might be what you're looking for.<br /><br /><i>Historically Significant</i>: <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GeneraOs">Genera OS</a><br />This was the operating system that ran on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics">Symbolics</a> <a href="http://www.sts.tu-harburg.de/~r.f.moeller/symbolics-info/symbolics.html">Lisp Machines</a>. It was reported to have a simply awe-inspiring development environment. It is still in use in animation houses and as a development environment.<br /><br /><i>Independant</i>: <a href="http://newos.org/">NewOS</a><br /> NewOS is a open source operating system with an emphasis on design and portability. It is largely implemented in C/C++, with a small amount of assembly. <font class="comment">Note: NewOS is used as the basis for <a href="http://www.danger.com/">Danger's Hiptop</a> device.</font><br /><br /><i>*nix</i>: <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a><br /> NetBSD is a free, secure, and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system available for many platforms...<br /><br /><b>Programming Language Oddities</b><br /><i>Minimalist</i>: <a href="http://alx2002.free.fr/esoterism/brainfuck/brainfuck_en.html">Brainf*ck</a><br />MÃ¼ller's goal was to create a simple Turing-complete programming language which could be implemented with the smallest possible compiler.  <font class="comment">Some interesting projects have come out of Brainf*ck, namely: a Huffman coded version named <a href="http://www.bluedust.com/spoon/">Spoon</a> and a <a href="http://martin.egy.nu/index.php?page=bfcomp">BF computer</a>.</font><br /><br />More to come...<br />-m
