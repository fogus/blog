<p>In response to Sports Guy’s recent question about my thoughts on the
Matt Riley for Ramon Nivar trade, I posted the following response:</p>
<p>I guess I would rather have… Not-Nivar.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, it’s tough to answer that question because I
suppose that I would rather have both, or neither. There are a lot of
variables to consider, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It’s always nice to have a surplus of pitching, but there comes a
time when a surplus is bad… this case in point. It probably doesn’t make
sense in the context of my ‘both’ position, but I am trying to look at
it from a perfect-world point of view. In a perfect world, Riley would
not have been rushed to the bigs in ’99, and probably would have been
placed into the bullpen for a year or two after his surgery.. prior to
this year. Placing him into the bullpen this year would have been
foolish because: he was groomed as a starter from the beginning of ST,
and he stunk up the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, I would imagine that over the past two seasons, given
the depth of pitching that the Orioles have had, a few other savvy GMs
may have been able to turn a package of those lost (Riley and Bautista
to start) into something far superior to what we got. Just consider a
package of Bauer/Riley/Bautista offered last year - not too shabby if
you ask me. It probably would not be enough to land a super-star, but it
would provide much more than a mediocre AAA ‘athlete’ and boring relief
pitcher.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As it stands, I think that the Orioles painted themselves into a
corner with this one and managed to make what they assumed was the best
deal possible – and I wouldn’t disagree with them given that I do not
think that Riley was worth very much at this point. However, the
Riley/Nivar deal represents a scary prospect that I have been harping on
with my disgust of the baseball ‘athlete’ and the hiring of Joe Jordan.
To me, losing Riley through waivers would have given me a better feeling
than reality.</p>
