<p>Well, within one day of my last posting about the Orioles’ glaring
hole at first, they went and signed Cpt. Leadership Jeff Conine.
Therefore, my dreams of asserting my will on the Brain (T)rust at Camden
Yards has been temporarily thwarted. However, I am resilient and will
therefore continue my quest to put together a plan for what I consider
to make the most sense for improvement for the team, given the market’s
current state. Therefore, today I turn my attention to what was one of
the biggest holes on the field last year for the team, RF. As we all
know, Sammy Sosa was a bust of monumental proportions. Few could have
imagined that in trading Sosa for Jerry Hairston, the Orioles would
receive the short end of the stick, but alas we did as Sosa’s OPS of
.671 will attest (compared to Hairston’s .704 OPS). It would be
extremely difficult to sign a player who would NOT provide an upgrade at
RF, but I will attempt to outline a few possibilities that I would find
tasteful for next season and perhaps future ones.</p>
<p><strong>Reggie Sanders</strong> The greatest part of Reggie Sanders
is that he is the quintessential hired gun. Therefore, any contract we
could sign with him could be for only one year. My only problem with
Sanders is that he is now 37 and could drop off in production
drastically very quickly, however, I would be willing to take that risk
in order to give both Majewski and Markakis another year of seasoning.
Last year, Sanders’ OPS was close to .900 which would be and extreme
improvement over the Sosa debacle. Even assuming that he might drop .100
points from his OPS, he is still a huge upgrade over Sosa.</p>
<p><strong>Gibbons/Byrnes Platoon</strong> Since Conine has arrived on
the scene and most likely taken over 1st (or is at least part of a
complex cycle involving all the wrong players revolving around it), I
thought I would revise my platoon involving Jay Gibbons and plug in
another player who happens to hit lefties quite well; Eric Byrnes. That
is, over the past 3 seasons Byrnes has an OPS of .885 versus LHP. While
that certainly still does not give the team a mashing right-field
platoon, it cannot be disputed that it would indeed be an upgrade from
last season. <em>Note: As of this writing, Eric Byrnes was non-tendered
by the Orioles, so this scenario is quickly fading.</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt Stairs/Brian Jordan Platoon</strong> This scenario might
be a stretch considering that both of these guys probably still consider
themselves starters and worth multi-year contracts. However, if they can
be convinced to take 1-year contracts to play part-time, then it starts
to make sense. First of all, Jordan is as fragile as a faberge egg, but
if he is relegated to play only against LHP, then his value becomes
apparent. When healthy over the past three years (something that was
sadly quite rare, but might be important to the Orioles during contract
negotiations) he has managed to put together an OPS of .869 vs LHP. The
biggest question with Jordan is whether or not his injuries has ruined
his career, but signing him to an incentive laden contract (or perhaps
even a minor league contract if we’re lucky) would not hurt the team too
much if he turned out a bomb. Stairs on the other hand is an interesting
case. Like Jordan his 3-year OPS has been .869 vs RHP, but there may be
a problem planting him (literally it seems) in RF and expecting league
average defensive play. However, the guy does tend to get on base at
around a .360-.370 clip; something sorely needed by the free-swinging
Orioles. It must be noted, that under <strong>NO</strong> circumstances
must either of these players’ contracts exceed 1-year in length or $1.5M
in salary. That’s my friends, is the definition of a tall task.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Dunn</strong> There has been a rumor floating around
that the Orioles discussed trading Bedard for Adam Dunn. If I were in
charge then I would probably make that deal given the need for a
slugging outfielder who can get on base regularly. However, what
complicates this deal currently is the fact that worthwhile pitchers who
might replace Bedard are disappearing at a phenomenal clip. However, as
a preview to my SP edition, I would push hard to sign Millwood as that
SP replacement for Bedard.</p>
