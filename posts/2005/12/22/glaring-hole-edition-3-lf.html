My previous posting concerning RF caused a bit of controversy on the
<a href="http://www.orioleshangout.com">Hangout</a> mostly centered
around the general consensus that the larger hole in the Orioles lineup
can be found in LF instead. While it is certainly true that there is a
large hole in LF (given the poor performance from Mr. Bigbie, Byrnes,
Newhan, Surhoff, and Cummings), the amalgamation of the LF rotation was
<strong>almost identical to Sosa</strong> in RF! Let’s look at the
comparisons:
<pre>Sosa in 2005:        .671 OPS (.295 OBP, .376 SLG)Aprox. LF in 2005:   .647 OPS (.285 OBP, .362 SLG)</pre>
<p>Wow! Our outfield really stunk last year (no big discovery here). Of
course having Gibbons in RF at times last year helped salvage some
semblance of what could be considered major-league hitting ability. I am
certainly down on Gibbons at times, the fact of the matter is that he is
(sadly) one of our best options for filling one of the gaping holes;
only if he is utilized properly in an effective platoon. However, he can
only play one position be it 1B, RF, or LF, and whichever he and his
platoon partner wind up, it would be wise to keep them there all season.
So to say that a bigger hole exists in either LF or RF is much like
saying that death by fire or molten hot magma is preferable. The exact
production was generated from both positions last year, and in both
cases a Gibbons/??? platoon could be used to increase production for
2006. That being said, I would like to present a few possibilities for
next year to help fill the hole that is LF (no particular preferential
ordering implied).</p>
<p><strong>Majewski/Byrnes</strong> It’s not too late to get Byrnes back
into the fold. Even though he has been non-tendered, the team can still
sign him at any time. If I were in charge I would look into signing him
as a way to spell Majewski versus tough lefties, plus he can play other
OF positions in a pinch. The question for Majewski is whether it is wise
to bring him to the majors after his shoulder injury. In a perfect
world, Majewski would be placed in AAA for another year, but the viable
options are running low at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Markakis/Byrnes</strong> Essentially the same can be said for
Markakis as was said for Majewski.</p>
<p><strong>Reggie Sanders</strong> Once again our friend Reggie Sanders
pops up as a possibility. Of course, the same applies as it did for his
inclusion in the <a href="/2005/12/filling-glaring-hole-rf.php">RF
edition</a>. That is, there should be no contract longer than 1 year and
no greater than his $4M salary from last year (maybe this could be a
LITTLE flexible). The point is that he could be a stop-gap while we wait
for Markakis and Majewski.</p>
<p>As you see, there are not a lot of options at LF, so maybe those guys
were right about it being a bigger hole. The above reflects my deep
distrust in the Brain (T)rust performing anything remotely resembling a
useful trade to fill this position. Sure, there are fantasy scenarios
where the team is able to spin some left-over parts for a future star in
LF, but let’s be honest; what are the odds? The long debate
continues.</p>
