<p>Now that Raphael Palmeiro has left Baltimore in disgrace, the Orioles
are left with a gaping hole at 1B for the upcoming 2006 season. While
Palmeiro’s performance was acceptable prior to his embarrassment,
afterward he was quite futile. Palmeiro’s 2005 VORP of 18.2 could easily
be replaced, or even improved upon via the free-agent or trade route in
the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Erubiel Durazo</strong> There is little dispute that Durazo
had a rough 2005 campaign, and it seems that his 2006 will probably be
even worse with a serious elbow injury. However, given that his VORP
numbers from 2003 and 2004 were 35.9 and 57.2 respectively, he might be
worth signing for pennies on the dollar now and hope that he gets better
before the end of the season, and/or 2007. This of course, might be too
great a risk for an organization gunshy about player injuries and spotty
medical reports.</p>
<p><strong>Hee Seop Choi</strong> Now that the Dodgers have made their
yearly bone-headed move by signing Nomar Garciapara to play firstbase,
the undervalued Choi is most likely available. He can probably be had
for very little via trade at this point. What Choi does provide however
is a player with some pop and a nice eye. The strangest aspect of Choi’s
2005 season is that he managed to hit much better at Dodger Stadium than
in away parks. What Choi gives you is at least the same production that
Palmeiro did at a younger age and a much smaller contract, with his
prime years ahead of him.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Gibbons/Eli Marrero Platoon</strong> As it turns out, one
of the best options for 2006 at firstbase turns out to be one of their
best options in 2005 that was never put into place. Apparently, the
Orioles did not believe in platooning players at all last year and
instead chose to play guys regardless of their hitting ability (or lack
thereof) in certain situations. Jay Gibbons it seems has trouble hitting
left handed pitchers as his .720 OPS (.299 OBP!) over the past 3 seasons
would indicate. Likewise, Marrero appears to have difficulties hitting
righties as his .602 OPS over the past 3 years would indicate. However,
as a platoon, Marrero and Gibbons make a lot of sense given the former’s
.802 OPS and the latter’s .973 OPS versus opposite handed pitchers over
the same 3 year span. Marrero was paid about $3.2M last season, but
could probably be signed for much less nowadays. This tandem might be a
good stopgap for a Durazo resurgence (see item #1) or even a potential
big signing at firstbase for 2007 (Lee?).</p>
<p><em>Note: Marrero could probably be replaced with Kevin Millar, but
that would probably be more costly for no appreciable increase in
returns.</em></p>
