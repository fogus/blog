The year was 1993 and The Cleaners had just wrapped up a successful show
in some Unitarian Church in Savage, MD. A few days later in Smoking Herb
Studios the following song, FThis, was recorded using a standard 4-track
in one take. The exact origin of this song has been lost to time, but
there is little dispute that is was our last song together. There are
also rumors of a 32-track Misfits tribute tape still in existence that
was meant to be given out as gifts to friends for Halloween, but which
was stolen by PDD when The Cleaners broke up. Reported copies of FThis
and the legendary 32-track extravaganza often sell on EBay for hundreds
of dollars, but do not be fooled my friends, they are frauds.
