<p><strong>VETERANICITY</strong> The condition of being a veteran. That
is, one providing leadership through the mere fact that he has been able
to stay on major-league (although other sports besides baseball apply)
rosters for more than 5 years, regardless of skill-level. Someone
displaying veteranicity is often accompanied by an unusually large
contract based entirely on his perceived level of veteranicity,
spunkitude, and/or youngster mentorosity.</p>
<p><strong>SPUNKITUDE</strong> The condition present in certain
ball-players which is often valued far above their quantifiable
contributions to a team. Spunkitude often presents itself in the form of
a dirty uniform, bloody arms, nagging injuries, high K/BB rates, stolen
bases, and low OBPs. Very often, players exhibiting high-levels of
veteranicity also display a propensity for spunkitude; although one does
not follow the other.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNGSTER MENTOROCITY</strong> A quality gained by all major
league players (although other sports besides baseball apply) once they
have achieved even trace levels of veteranicity. It is a fact that on
the 5th anniversary of a given player’s inception into the majors, a
long dormant leadership gene, present in all athletes, is essentially
switched on thus compelling said player to seek a mentoring relationship
with all available young players. Youngster mentorocity is often
accompanied by a level of spunkitude and absolutely cannot exist without
some level of veteranicity.</p>
<p><strong>IN-TRANSITHOOD</strong> The condition of a major league
player (although other sports besides baseball apply) who was once a
star player (length of time is irrelevant) to retain perceived value far
above his quantifiable value for many years after his ability goes
super-nova. Very often, said player’s quantifiable worth is replaced by
high levels of veteranicity, spunkitude, and youngster mentorocity. It
is believed that the easiest way for a player to accumulate
in-transithood is for him to perform extremely well during the playoffs,
and/or hit over .350 for at least one season (see Carlos Beltran and
Darin Erstad for recent examples).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSITIVITY</strong> Not to be confused with in-transithood
(see above). Refers to the perceived value of a player X due to his
relationship to another (or group) player. A transitive relationship
between two players might range from statistical similarities at a
certain age, to handedness, to body build types; all of which are
perceived equally valid methods of evaluating future success or failure.
Example: Larry Bigbie and Ed Goodson both bat leftie and had similar
numbers at the age of 26. Ed Goodson and Paul O’Neil both bat leftie and
had similar numbers at the age of 25. Therefore, Larry Bigbie is the
next Paul O’Neil.</p>
