<p>I am taking the Traff-o-Data approach to releasing software.  That is, while this new WordPress based blog is potentially full of bugs and has a whacky color-scheme, I am dubbing it Modus Ponens v2.0 and then fixing things as I go along.  In the next few weeks I will probably kick all worthy posts from Modus Ponens v1.0 to this site for preservation&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this blog will soon be accessable through the www.modus-ponens.com domain name, but will always be accessible via blog.minotaurcomputing.com/mp.  Also, the site feed for v2.0 is http://blog.minotaurcomputing.com/mp/feed; please check it out.</p>
<p>This space will be constantly changing appearance, so don&#8217;t be put off too much.  Feel free to offer suggestions for things that might enhance your v2.0 experience, and always report bugs.</p>
<p>Finally, the official email address for this blog will be:</p>
<p>em pee at minotaurcomputing dot com</p>
