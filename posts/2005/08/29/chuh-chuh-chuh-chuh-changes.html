<p>Having gone into one of my periodic blog-posting funks recently, I
had decided to change the way that I handle my postings. That is, I no
longer have the desire to maintain a blog containing nothing but
collections of links to other sites’ articles. There is nothing
inherently exciting about that approach. Instead, I hope to first make a
clean cut from Blogger in leu of
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and then to simply use
that webspace as purely original postings. Of course, I fully expect
that space to have less frequent updates, but at least it is something
that I can look back on 10 years from now and know what I was thinking…
not just what I happened to be reading on the net. I am still trying to
compile a list of postable topics, but preliminary ruminations have
produced the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dreams: I enjoy reading
<a href="http://blog.founddrama.net">FD</a>’s offerings, and plan on
completely ripping it off</p></li>
<li><p>Personal Project Updates: I have about 6 different programming
projects that I am juggling at any giving time. This space would be a
great place to create a developer’s notebook updating the state of
each.</p></li>
<li><p>Thoughts on medium consumption: Thoughts and notes on books,
movies, news, etc… that I may have found interesting (or
wretched).</p></li>
<li><p>Travel Log: Nuff said.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideas for stuff: What would I do if… scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting Interviews with Interesting People: The hope is to
provide original interviews… but most likely will contain the best of
the best from people I find brilliant, whacky, or a combination of the
two.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What will NOT be seen on the new webspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>News of the Weird</li>
<li>Tech news in brief</li>
<li>Reading Queues</li>
<li>Anything not spawned from mine mind (exceptions to be determined on
a whim)</li>
</ul>
<p>That is all I have at the moment. Any reader suggestions will first
be scoffed, then stolen as original ideas.</p>
