A lot of Apple fans are hoping that this time a Tablet Mac will become a reality, while many others point to the lackluster sales of the Tablet PC and think it would be a mistake for Apple to offer the same thing. But, unlike Tablet PCâ€™s the new patent awarded to Apple point to something much different than what PC companies have offered so far."
