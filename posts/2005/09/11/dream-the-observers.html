They only came at night. Or that’s what we thought anyway. We were
staying at an old mansion located near my childhood home, and the
weather was arctic (the reason never mentioned). We were running out of
food, and after a few days the electricity went dark, never to come back
on. The next night, the observers came. We noticed their footprints in
the snow at first, but eventually we would begin to sense them watching
us. We could feel them in the rooms with us, and could hear the
footsteps in the night. As is expected, this really frightened us, but
the need for food overwhelmed any fears. Eventually, we came across some
food (the how is not clear anymore) and although it helped to keep us
alive, it provoked the observers into taking a more active role. The
same night they came and became very violent toward the weakest of the
group, and in one case took a person with them. At that point it was
decided that we would sleep during the day, and generate light in the
darkness with fire as it was assumed that they despised the light. This
seemed to work for the first day, for it seemed as if the observers kept
a distance to the fire, although we could all sense that they were still
watching us from afar, and our theory was validated by the cluster of
footprints found by some in the morning. We followed this same routine
for a week and every night it was the same; the observers always came
and always watched. However, one night they were no longer watching; we
could feel that they were no longer lurking at the perimeter of light. A
few days passed without incident and spirits were high based on that.
Unfortunately, we soon learned that our initial theory was incorrect and
the observers were not afraid of the light. As we quickly learned, they
instead changed their strategy and came at us during the day, when the
majority was now sleeping. As before, they preyed upon the weak and
stole away half of the group. As this was occuring, the remainders
noticed that at certain light angles one could see a faint outline of
what appeared to be a military uniform shirt. This would soon disappear
however, as the observers would always move. The next day came and again
the observers came, taking the remainder of the group except me. Fear
and desperation almost overtook me waiting for the next day, and as it
turned out the observers indeed came. This day they were much more bold,
and did not take efforts to hide themselves as they outnumbered me 2 to
1. I tried to ask them what they wanted, but they simply stood and
stared for hours, guarding the exit to the room where I was trapped.
Eventually, I realized that escape was futile and in frustration and a
desire for a resolution I rushed one of the observers, knocking it to
the ground. As a tore at it with my hands and teeth I could sense that
the second observer simply watched. As I ripped at the now helpless
observer that I had pinned it made no sounds of pain nor fought to be
released; it simply allowed me to tear it to ribbons and eventually died
the way that it had lived, in complete silence. When I turned to
confront the second observer, I saw that it was fleeing from the room. I
followed it throughout the mansion, only catching glimpses of that shirt
in the light. This chase went on for a few minutes, eventually ending in
the dining hall where what I saw made me stop. The light from the giant
sunroof in the dining hall highlighted more than a 2 dozen faint shirts
known to be worn by the observers. At that moment of realization of
impending doom the sun crawled beneath the horizon cutting out the
remaining light and also causing every shirt to disappear into the
darkness. The last sound that I remember before waking was that of many
footsteps rapidly rushing toward me.<br /> -m
