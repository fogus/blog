The war was over and thus the wounded soldiers, stitched back together,
no longer needed to be paraded in front of the cameras as a show of good
faith and therefore no longer needed to be stiched. Instead, they were
locked into a huge auditorium and fed once a day via a huge vat of
sludge appearing at the door. The soldiers without arms get to the food
first with a mad dash and plant their faces into the slop. Those without
legs are forced to pull themselves along the floor slowly and always
wound up eating the saliva-tainted remains. Of course this caused a
problem because the leftovers always happened to be at the bottom of the
vat so they were forced to tip the vat, spilling the contents onto the
floor. Those unable to move were never helped or fed and eventually died
a slow painful death; their corpses remaining among the living.<br /> -m
