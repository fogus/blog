<p>The following books are certainly not among the top tier of horror
fiction choices, but they are worth a read because frankly one could go
crazy reading only classics.</p>
<p><em>Reign of the Dead and Apocalypse End by Len Barnhart</em> If I
had to guess, I would say that Barnhart is from the northern Virginia
area. Both of his books talk heavily of local landmarks and towns and it
is possibly because of this that I enjoyed these books about zombie
infestation. I suppose that if zombies do one day rise, then this series
would be my handbook for survival.</p>
<p><em>The Rising and City of the Dead by Brian Keene</em> Another
zombie book, this one more mainstream than the first two. The zombies in
this book are not the shambling ghouls, but planning, running, cursing
bad-asses.</p>
<p><em>Event Horizon by Steven McDonald</em> I’m not really sure which
came first, this book, or the movie. In any case, the book is a nice
story connecting black holes and demonology. While the movie was pretty
good, the book is slightly better simply because it is less convoluted.
It will certainly not challenge your intellect, but it is an
entertaining read on a short trip.</p>
<p><em>Interview with the Vampire</em> Some may place this into the
upper tier of horror fiction, but since this is my list they can bite
me. Granted, it was a good book, it didn’t present much in the way of
chills that a good horror novel should.</p>
<p><em>Books of Blood 1-3 by Barker</em> A pretty good collection of
horror, some good, some bad, some great, some poor, you get the
hint.</p>
<p><em>Intensity by Dean Koontz</em> I REALLY wanted to like this book
more than I did. It started very well with some of the most tense scenes
I can recall in any of the aforementioned books. Sadly, towards the last
1/4th of the book I found myself skipping whole paragraphs… never a good
sign.</p>
<p><em>Frankenstein Unbound by Brian Aldiss</em> A pretty good movie was
made of this book and in reality may have been better. However, when the
author of “Super Toys Last All Summer Long” writes his take on the
modern Prometheus one must take the time to check it out.</p>
