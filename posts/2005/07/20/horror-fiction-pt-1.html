<p>For those looking to sample the best that horror fiction has to
offer, I present my modest opinion on the matter. There was a time when
I believed that the only art worth sampling was steeped in horror, be it
film, game, or fiction. However, after a time I realized that, more
often than not, horror in both film and gaming blew goats. Essentially,
for every Suspiria there are 100 Jeepers Creepers. Likewise, for every
Lurking Horror there are dozens of KISS: Psycho Circus games. However,
horror fiction is an extremely mature and effective mechanism for
delivering chills. That is not to say that there is not a mountain of
dreck, there is, it’s just that horror fiction has a history as old as
fiction itself and because of that, there is a lifetime of available
titles for those interested. Having read my fair share of horror
fiction, the following list enumerates some of my favorites (in no
particular order).</p>
<p><strong>Classics</strong> <em>Frankenstein</em> When I first read
Frankenstein it did not scare me at all, although it was a pretty good
book. I realize now that everything in the book has been rehashed
innumerably and I had been exposed to it all previously. Too bad. I
place it on this list for posterity’s sake.</p>
<p><em>Dracula</em> Like Frankenstein, most of the elements of Dracula
have been stolen by film and fiction alike. However, the prose in the
book is genuinely creepy and does not generally translate well to hack
fiction and film.</p>
<p><em>Macbeth</em> Ghosts, murder, and witches from Shakespeare… and
they also let me read it in high school. Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-WWII</strong> <em>The Turn of the Screw by Henry
James</em> An amazing ghost story. Additionally, it is an easy read and
ideal for a stormy night.</p>
<p><em>The House of Souls by Arthur Machen</em> Machen is credited as on
of HP Lovecraft’s primary influences, and in reading this collection of
novellas one can see why.</p>
<p><em>The Case of Charles Dexter Ward by HP Lovecraft</em> Lovecraft
has published many great stories, by this is easily my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Golden Age</strong> <em>I Am Legend by Matherson</em> A
great vampire story which was spun into two pretty good movie
adaptations (as far as adaptations go): The Omega Man and The Last Man
on Earth.</p>
<p><em>Psycho by Robert Bloch</em> The invention of the modern
psycho-killer archetype.</p>
<p><em>The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson</em> A solid
haunted house tale sustaining a constant state of dread. I read this
book for the first time a month ago and was actually creeped out for the
first time in years.</p>
<p><em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> The best of the pre-golden age horror
novels. Together with HofHH, RB lays the groundwork for the acceptance
of horror fiction defining the golden age.</p>
<p><strong>The Golden Age of Horror</strong> <em>The Exorcist by
Blatty</em> This is the book that triggered the golden age of horror.
More horror classics were written in the decade following than in any
such span in history… IMO. This is a genuinely scary book, although I
have recently found that the horror does not translate well to
non-Christian influenced readers.</p>
<p><em>Salem’s Lot by King</em> King’s second book and his best as far
as I’ve read. The movies made from this book do it no justice. This is a
pretty straight-forward vampire tale, but with many well done
scenes.</p>
<p><em>The Other by Thomas Tryon</em> Tryon was a failed actor, but this
story of creepy twins instantly secured his place in history. Sadly,
this book is not often reprinted and a nice copy is difficult to
find.</p>
<p><em>Wolfen by Streiber</em> One of the best werewolf books yet
written. The movies made from this book are not worth watching.</p>
<p><em>The Shining by King</em> King’s glory days were definitely during
the 70s. While his later work contained a few gems, his output during
the disco age earned him his reputation and place in horror history. Was
he the best horror writer ever? No. But his 70s novels are the most
likely to be marked as classics in horror fiction 100 years from
now.</p>
<p><em>Ghost Story by Straub</em> I do not care for any of Straub’s
other books, but GS was an extremely good horror novel about ghosts,
werewolves, death cults, zombies, and the unexplained. It is odd in that
it tries to touch on many different themes and yet succeeds.</p>
<p><strong>The 80s</strong> <em>The Wasp Factory by Banks</em> One of my
favorite novels period… nevermind the horror genre, it stands on its
own.</p>
<p><em>The Silence of the Lambs by Harris</em> While not the best novel
ever, the movie made from it is a classic. In addition, Harris
masterfully molds the archetype created by Bloch into a truly memorable
character in Hannibal Lecter.</p>
<p><em>Hellbound Heart</em> Still the best story by Barker IMO. Winds
the decadence of the 80s with demonology.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Horror</strong> <em>Exquisite Corpse by Poppy Z.
Brite</em> Not for the squeamish, but pretty damn good from an
ex-alt.horror poster.</p>
<p><em>American Psycho</em> Again, not for the squeamish. Inside a wall
street mind a psycho lurks; lines of cocaine cut in hell.</p>
<p><em>House of Leaves</em> Like Wasp Factory, this book transcends its
genre. In short, it is simply about a house that is bigger on the inside
than the outside. The execution of this simple premise is breathtaking.
