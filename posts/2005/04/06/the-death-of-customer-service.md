Perhaps it's just me, Yuki, her family, and my family, but it certainly seems as if there is a growing trend in the worthlessness of customer service.  Actually, worthless would be an upgrade over the damaging service that we have experienced recently.  It is quite amazing, but since recently dealing with the sattelite and cell providers, I have found myself pining for the days of attempting to cancel an AOL subscription.  I hate to sound like an old codger, but I do not remember customer service being this pathetic when I was <img src="http://www.networkcarecard.com/images/custservice.jpg" align="left"> a kid, although I was pretty clueless about anything not involving skating or computers; so perhaps I am wrong.  It seems that in general, the customer has devolved from the classical definition into more of a nusciance.  Computer stores have always been a joke (I believe that bad Compaq customer service years ago was a strong motivating factor in my desire to learn as much as I could about hardware), but lately the ineptitude is almost mythical.  Hint: 1) a hub is not a switch, as much as you would like it to be, 2) 802.11b is not the serial number, and 3) the Apple Store Genius Bar is a misnomer.  Sigh.<br />-m
