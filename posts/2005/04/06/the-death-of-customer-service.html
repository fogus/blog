<p>Perhaps it’s just me, Yuki, her family, and my family, but it
certainly seems as if there is a growing trend in the worthlessness of
customer service. Actually, worthless would be an upgrade over the
damaging service that we have experienced recently. It is quite amazing,
but since recently dealing with the sattelite and cell providers, I have
found myself pining for the days of attempting to cancel an AOL
subscription. I hate to sound like an old codger, but I do not remember
customer service being this pathetic when I was

a kid, although I was pretty clueless about anything not involving
skating or computers; so perhaps I am wrong. It seems that in general,
the customer has devolved from the classical definition into more of a
nusciance. Computer stores have always been a joke (I believe that bad
Compaq customer service years ago was a strong motivating factor in my
desire to learn as much as I could about hardware), but lately the
ineptitude is almost mythical. Hint: 1) a hub is not a switch, as much
as you would like it to be, 2) 802.11b is not the serial number, and 3)
the Apple Store Genius Bar is a misnomer. Sigh.<br />-m</p>
