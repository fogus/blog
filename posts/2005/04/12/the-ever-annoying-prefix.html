<p>Why is it that the recent trend in development is to create projects
names that hint at the fact they happened to be written in Python, Java,
or for the Mac? It seems a bit silly to me that every project created
using Python should be named PySomething or some other nonsense starting
with the letter P. Granted, I too am guilty of such behavior, but I tend
to start with prefixed names and eventually change them when something
more clever strikes me. However, this tends to not be the model for man
and as a result we are stuck with a never ending parade of PyThis and
JThat and iSomethingOrOther. Perl, C, Ruby, C++, and countless other
developers somehow resist the urge to name every app according to their
chosen language meme. You rarely see apps prepended with pl, c, r, cpp,
lisp, or whatever, even though anyone of those choices are just as valid
as py, J, or i. It tends to annoy me that Apple would spend countless
hours developing some fantastic application only to in the end call it
iTunes. Further, by naming such a great tool iTunes, Apple is tying it
to less worthy iApps such as iCal, iPhoto, and iSync. Likewise, there is
an army of OSX developers willing to adopt such a brain dead naming
scheme (one that even Apple doesn’t follow exclusively). Perhaps with
Java it makes a bit more sense, but only in some cases. For example,
JUnit is a perfectly valid use of the J prefix… and that might be the
lone exception. Don’t even get me started on the debacle being
perpetrated by Python developers. There are almost an infinite amount of
pySomething application names, many of which are extremely mundane words
with a cute little py tacked onto the front: PyCalendar, PyBlog, PyLisp,
PyTools, PyMenu, PyGraph… and on and on. I guarantee that if you type
ANY word into Google with Py appended to the front, you will find at
least one hit; often many more (each a different project). Now I may be
splitting hairs here, but it intrigues me that this behavior only seems
to follow certain computing subcultures. I do not expect an answer to
this question to be forthcoming.<br />-m</p>
