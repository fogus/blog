I have spoken with countless programmers in my life, and have found that there are a few languages that are not only used, but loved.  Likewise, there are other languages that tend to be used (usually for work), but are rarely ever loved.  In between, are the languages that people do not have strong feelings for either way, or the jury is still deliberating on.
<br />
<br /><b>Loved Languages</b>
<br />C, Lisp, Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, Perl (in the same way that Hilary Clinton is loved), APL, Eiffel, Scheme, PHP
<br />
<br /><b>Un-Loved Languages</b>
<br />C++, Ada, Perl (in the same way that Hilary Clinton is hated), Pascal, Delphi, COBOL, Fortran, VisualBasic, BASIC
<br />
<br /><b>That Gray Area</b>
<br />Java, C#, Prolog, Javascript
<br />-m
