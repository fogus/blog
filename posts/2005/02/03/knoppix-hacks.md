<a href="http://www.techbookreport.com/tbr0127.html">TechBookReport - Knoppix Hacks</a>: "Knoppix Hacks, assembled by Kyle Rankin, collects in one place a hundred 'industrial-strength' tips and techniques for getting the best out of Knoppix. What's more the book comes with a CD, meaning that you can keep them together as an essential part of your tool-kit. Think of this as a super-strength toolkit and instruction manual in one."
