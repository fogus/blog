<p>Much has been said about the potential of Larry Bigbie to be an
impact player in the major leagues. I have in the past compared him
favorably with a young
<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/o/o%27neipa01.shtml">Paul
O’Neall</a>; but how does that analogy hold up under the microscope?</p>
While O’Neall did make it to the majors at the age of 22 (compared to
Bigbie’s 23), by the time both players were 25 years old they had
surprisingly similar stats:

<strong>Paul O'Neill</strong>

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

 1986 23 3    2    0    0   0  0   0    0   0   1  .000  .333  .000

 1988 25 145 485  58  122  25  3  16   73  38  65  .252  .306  .414

Clearly, O’Neill’s raw stats outweigh Bigbie’s at the age of 25 due to
more playing time. However, if we were to scale Bigbie’s stats onto the
same number of games and ABs as O’Neill had, a plausible reason behind
Bigbie’s small playing time may be found:
<pre><strong>Larry Bigbie (scaled relatively)</strong>
 Year Ag G   AB    R    H   2B 3B  HR  RBI  BB  SO   BA   OBP   SLG
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
      25 237 659   96   179 32  1  16  neg  69  165  .272 .339  .398</pre>
Observing these stats, a few items immediately jump to mind:
<ul>
<li>
Bigbie would have scored roughly 15% more runs than O’Neill, most likely
due to the significantly larger OBP.
</li>
<li>
Bigbie would have struck out 170% of what O’Neill did.
</li>
<li>
Bigbie’s SLG is markedly lower than O’Neill’s
</li>
</ul>
Of course, all of these points preclude that Bigbie would have continued
at his historical rate during the extra ABs in the scaled model. As we
all know, in baseball anything can happen in the span of 207 ABs (the
difference between the historic stats and the scaled). All caveats
aside, it is the second two items that might explain why Bigbie was
refused the same chance as O’Neill had during his early years. That is,
there is a tremendous stigma against the strike out that still persists
in today’s baseball climate (is there any doubt that Adam Dunn would
have been far more revered than he was had he not struck out 195 times
in 2004). Coupling his strikeout rate with the fact that Bigbie until
that point was an extremely weak hitter, and the picture becomes clear.
That is, O’Neill’s career SLG at the age of 25 was much more impressive
than Bigbie’s during the highly touted juiced ball era. In fact,
O’Neill’s SLG for that time was above league average (.383), while
Bigbie’s fell below (~.420) for his era. Simply put, a weak hitting
outfielder who strikes out a lot simply doesn’t get a lot of ABs in the
major leagues. However, Bigbie’s performance for that time cannot be
viewed in a vacuum. That is, if we compare his scaled stats with those
of the players he might have replaced for that time, then an interesting
dilemma arises. Of course, in 2001 the lion’s share of outfield ABs were
wasted on a floundering
<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/a/anderbr01.shtml">Brady
Anderson</a> at the end of his career, and a similarly positioned Delino
DeSheilds. Between the two, the following ‘stellar’ lines emerged:
<pre><strong>Anderson and DeSheilds - 2001</strong>
 Year Ag G   AB    R    H   2B 3B  HR  RBI  BB  SO   BA   OBP   SLG
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
             618   79   124 20  5  11  66   91  119  .201 .311  .303</pre>
<p>In a word… OUCH! 2001 fell within the tenure of Mike Hargrove, and a
common view is that he always benched young players in lieu of veterans.
However, even a cursory glance shows that is not in fact. In fact, Jerry
Hairston, Jay Gibbons, and Brian Roberts found substantial playing time
during the 2001 season while Sidney Ponson, Josh Towers, and BJ Ryan all
pitched regularly. What about 2002? Of course, it is difficult to build
a case for playing Bigbie in 2002 given the emergence of Gary Matthews
and Jay Gibbons that season, as well as the eventual All-Star calibre
play of Mora (although that season was rough for him). However, it is
difficult to believe that given a full season of playing time, Bigbie
would have been a worse option than either of Marty Cordova, Chris
Singeton, Luis Lopez, or Chris Richard. While Bigbie received 34 ABs for
the year 2002, the four players mentioned received 1079 ABs, had a
.250/.302/.407 AVG/OBP/SLG line, and struck out 244 times (a separate
article could thus be written on the injustice of not playing Howie
Clark that year, but I will leave that exercise to the reader). For both
2001 and 2002, it is conceivable that Bigbie would have been a much
better option than those provided. It is my belief that 2002
specifically caused Hargrove to garner the ‘veteran’ bias label that was
pinned to his forehead. However, again Hairston, Gibbons, Ponson, Ryan,
and even Julio and Bauer suggest otherwise. My guess is that Hargrove
tended to have a bias against young, weak-hitting outfielders who struck
out a lot (which Bigbie clearly at that time). However, it appeared that
he had no issues playing veterans matching the latter two patterns.</p>
It seems that I have drifted far afield from my original intention of
comparing Bigbie with a young Paul O’Neill. However, by the end of this
article it may seem clearer how the previous digression fits into the
larger picture. Having examined both players up to the age of 25 and
found quite similar players, the truly striking resemblance comes at the
age of 26. Specifically:
