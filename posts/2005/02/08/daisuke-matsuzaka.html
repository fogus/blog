There are many in Japan who think that the next Japanese star in the
major leagues will be a dominant pitcher by the name of Daisuke
Matsuzaka. He has been a force at the top of the rotation for the Seibu
Lions, helped Japan win the Bronze in the 2004 Summer Olympics (he
actually beat Cuba in the preliminaries), and has his eye on the Major
Leagues as early as the 2006 season. Of course, he will not be eligible
for free agency for another 3 seasons, but it is possible that his team
(having just been sold) could post him to the highest bidder (much as
what happened with Ichiro) as soon as this year.

Interesting facts:
- Was the #1 pick of the Seibu Lions in the 1999 draft
- Pitched a 1-run CG against the USA all-stars in the 2004 USA/Japan series.
- Helped the Lions win the 2004 Japan Championships; there 1st such victory in 12 years.
- Recently signed a contract worth 250 million yen (~$2,500,000) per season.</pre>
<p>There are questions about Matsuzaka’s health and rightly so given the
extreme amount of work before the age of 25 (44 CGs!!). It is speculated
that the Lions would be willing to offer him to the highest MLB team
quickly, before his workload catches up with him. Regardless, I would
imagine that when he finally does come to play in the majors, then he
will command a hefty salary.</p>
