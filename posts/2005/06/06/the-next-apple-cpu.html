<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_M#Yonah">Pentium M:
Merom</a>: “Intel expects to launch the Merom core in the second half of
2006. Merom will support the EM64T instruction set, and will serve as
the basis for a new desktop core, Conroe.”<br /><br />So it is official.
Apple is switching to Intel chips within the next 2 years. How does this
make me feel as a long time Apple user? It sucks, but not for the
reasons that you might imagine. Personally, I couldn’t care less if my
computer has a G5,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_M#Yonah">Intel Merom</a>,
or an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_COSMAC">RCA Cosmac
1802</a>. As a programmer, I care very little for the underlying
architecture and instead live in the realm of the API. OSX provides a
slick API and Objective C is sharp, but I have not been compelled to
utilize either to their fullest. Instead, I find myself more and more
drawn to the cross-platform GUI solutions like
<a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">Wx</a> and platform agnostic
languages like Ruby, Python, and Java. Sure performance is a big
deal-breaker for me, but I simply cannot tell a lick of difference
between a 3.4 GHZ P4 and a 2.0 GHZ G5 for 99% of the tasks that I
perform. The only real time that I notice anything is when my chess
program
<a href="http://wiki.minotaurcomputing.com/index.php?pagename=Hikeeba%20Chess">Hikeeba</a>
<br />crunches only 534,211 positions per seconds as opposed to 562,809…
either way it still kicks my ass. No the heartburn for me in this
decision is that I have already watched it unfold over ten years ago
during the legacy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT#NeXT_Software">NeXTStep and
OpenStep</a>. Maybe Jobs has figured out where he went wrong last time,
and maybe he really knows what he is doing… but I remain skeptical. In
any case, I do not plan on selling my G5 (at the moment), and will in
fact make it a Linux-only box whenever Apple decides to stop supporting
running OSX on it.<br /><br />-m</p>
