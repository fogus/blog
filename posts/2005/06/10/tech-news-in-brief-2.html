- Japan drums up robot support - Jun 10, 2005</a>: “One model called
Batting Robot has a vision system that handles 1,000 images a second,
more than 30 times the human eye, allowing it to accurately hit pitches
of up to 160 kph (100 mph). At the expo, however, it was using a plastic
bat to hit rubber balls at far slower speeds.”</p>

QuickTime - WWDC 2005</a>: “Watch Apple CEO Steve Jobs kick-off the
Worldwide Developers Conference with a keynote address from San
Francisco’s Moscone West. See the video-on-demand event right here
exclusively in QuickTime and MPEG-4.”</p>

freezes over; it must’ve been the liquid cooling: Hannibal on the
Apple-to-Intel transition : Page 1</a>: “Conroe is a dual-core desktop
chip that has all of the features in my list above, and is based on the
successor to the Pentium M’s ‘Banias’ architecture. This new,
‘completely revamped’ dual-core architecture will supposedly give a
20-30% performance boost over the current Pentium M and will be the nail
in the coffin of the power-inefficient Netburst architecture. I think
Conroe is the most likely candidate for the first Intel-based PowerMac,
because it would allow Apple to skip Netburst entirely.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=23055">Intel panics and
announces Merom</a>: “The chips themselves throw out the failed P4
‘Netbust’ architecture and are based on the Pentium M philosophy of
shorter and more efficient pipelines. I have heard 12 or 13 stages from
several people. Don’t look for clock speeds anywhere near that of
Netburst products, more in the 2.5GHz range for the desktop parts.”</p>

they’re being reviewed for potential for world domination”</p>
