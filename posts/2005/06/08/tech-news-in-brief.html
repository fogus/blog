<p><a href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/">The WebKit Open Source
Project</a>: “Welcome to the web site for the WebKit Open Source
Project. WebKit is the system framework used on Mac OS X by Safari,
Dashboard, Mail.app, and many other OS X applications. It is based on
the KHTML engine from KDE.”</p>
<p><font class="comment">This is an interesting development. There have
been
<a href="http://www.osviews.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=4400">whispers
</a> that Apple’s relationship has soured with the KHTML OOS team, and
this may be their effort to make things right.</font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0506intelxbench.html">Think
Secret - New Mac OS X 10.4.2 build, Intel Mac benchmarks</a>: “Overall,
the Intel Mac are scoring between 65 and 70 with Xbench, a far cry from
the 200 scores higher-end G5 systems reach. The CPU test is landing in
the high teens compared with scores of 100 to 200 for G5 systems, but
that appears to be primarily due to lackluster FPU scores. According to
a recent Macworld story, Rosetta does not support AltiVec instructions,
which substanties the results.”</p>
<p><font class="comment">Ahh yes, it was just a matter of time before
XBench results would show up; but this soon?!? I have been contemplating
grabbing one of those x86 development systems for OSX, but the little
voice inside my head says, “don’t look back, you can never look
back.”</font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.accelerateyourmac.com/">Accelerate Your
Macintosh! News Page - 6/8/05</a>: “What does it mean? Open Firmware is
responsible for a great deal of seamless work and a great deal of
so-called ‘Macintosh experience’ is thanks to Open Firmware. With
Intel-based Mac the Open Firmware is gone. What we will have instead?
There could be two choices: the new 64-bit EFI boot driver initiative
from major players like Intel/Microsoft/Adaptec/etc
(http://www.intel.com/technology/efi/) or… the standard BIOS which would
reflect the ancient PC motherboard architecture.”</p>
<p><font class="comment">A fascinating look into some of the development
implications of Apple’s switch to Intel. Specifically, check out the
great summary of the BIOS limitations.</font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,67742,00.html?tw=rss.GAM">Wired
News: PSP Hackers Go Retro</a>: “But the development of emulators for a
new operating system is usually a slow and laborious process, so the
speed and accuracy with which anonymous Japanese hackers have mastered
the PSP has been surprising.”</p>
<p><font class="comment">This ALMOST makes me want to buy a PSP. If they
somehow manage C64 on it then I am there.</font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.myfreebsd.com.br/static/raymond-20050604.html">[www.MyFreeBSD.com.br]
- Eric Raymond talks about GPL and BSD licenses</a>: “Freedom and choice
are pretty cool. But we should talk about many other things. GPL is
based on the belief that open source software is weak and needs to be
protected. With it, we continue injuring ourselves, cutting ourselves
from the economic benefits of BSD license”</p>
<p><font class="comment">Sun plans to make
<a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/">OpenSolaris</a> available some
time next week. Check out the
<a href="http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox-360/perfect-dark-zero/613063p1.html?fromint=1">specs
for the XBox 360</a>… sweet. If I had to guess, I would say that the
plans to use the PPC CPU in the next generation of game consoles led to
the split between IBM and Apple. </font></p>
