<p>Some of the worst players during the Camden Yards era:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Billy Ripken</span> - Was quite bad,
then left the Orioles, started to play close to average, then came back
and was as bad as ever. A lot of wasted ABs were used up on BRip.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Glen Davis</span> - nuff said</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Brett Barberie</span> - I absolutely
<span style="font-weight: bold">hated</span> this guy when he was traded
for (and to add insult to injury, I loved Jay Powell), and my impression
of him was further darkened by his performance.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Tony Tarasco</span> - TT will go
down as the guy who had the catch stolen by that kid in Yankees’
stadium… but as it turns out he was a pretty bad player too.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Ryan Minor</span> - nuff said. Gets
my vote as the <span style="font-weight: bold">worst hitter of the
Camden yards era</span>… 222 ABs, 41 H, 66 SO. Ouch.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Arthur Rhodes</span> - Went on to be
a star, but during his stay with the Orioles at Camden Yards he was
quite bad. Although he did have a 3-year stretch where he was decent, so
he might not belong on this list.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Sid Fernandez</span> - Completely
worthless as an Oriole, was then released close to the trade deadline.
He gets my vote as the <span style="font-weight: bold">worst pitcher of
the Camden Yards era</span> thanks to performance and wasted money.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Brad Pennington</span> - He pitched
very little, but when he did he was phenominally bad. Usually guys who
pitch ~40 innings for a club are eventually forgotten, but Brad has made
a permanent smear on Orioles lore. His AB versus Ken Griffey where he
gave up what seemed like a 700 ft. homer stands as the <span
style="font-weight: bold">worst AB in the Camden Yards era</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Kent Mercker</span> - Was the
unknown gem in the Braves rotation, or so the Orioles thought. They
wound up trading a pretty usefull player in Joe Borowski for 1/2 of a
wretched season. The bright side is that they did manage to trade him
for Eddie Murray, who had a decent 2nd half of a season, helping the
Orioles make the playoffs.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Shawn Boskie</span> - Wow, I really
hated when the Orioles signed this guy. He was one of those players who
was able to parlay one good season into big contracts and multiple spots
on major league rosters. The Orioles fell into this trap and paid a
vicious price for it… a year later he was out of baseball.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Honorable mentions</span>: Pat Rapp,
Manny Alexander, Alan Mills, Jeff Tackett</p>
<p>Finally, the <span style="font-weight: bold">worst season
performance</span> of the Camden Yards era has to be Cal Ripken’s 2001
season. He managed to end his illustrious career on a very sour note,
compiling a .637 OPS in a phenominal 477 ABs. If any season epitomized
the fall of a baseball legend, it was Ripken’s 2001. It was sad to see,
and very very painful to watch.</p>
