<p>The last time that the Orioles had baseball’s 1st pick in the June
draft, they chose the (in)famous Ben McDonald from Louisiana State
University. Since that time, the team has proven notorious for making
bad picks. I thought it might be a nice exercise to celebrate the
upcoming draft with a look at the players the Orioles could have wound
up with had they drafted perfectly and been able to sign all of their
selections.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1990</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">20th pick - Mike Mussina</span> Could have
picked: No one of consequence; great draft pick.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1991</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">9th pick - Mark Smith</span> Could have
picked: Shawn Estes (11) Manny Ramirez (13) Cliff Floyd (14) Shawn Green
(16) Pokey Reese (20) Aaron Sele (23) Scott Hatteberg (43) Nomar
Garciaparra (131)</p>
<p>The picks of both Manny Ramirez and Shawn Green a few picks later
really sting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1992</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">4th pick - Jeffrey Hammonds</span> Could have
picked: Derek Jeter (6) Preston Wilson (9) Shannon Stewart (19) Jason
Kendall (23) Johnny Damon (35) Todd Helton (55)</p>
<p>Missing out on Derek Jeter 2 picks later seems like a huge gaff.
However, I seem to recall there being some particular reason why he was
not picked. Perhaps it was the presence of Cal, but that factoid is lost
to the dustbin of my brain. Maybe someone could refresh my memory.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1993</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">19th pick - Jay Powell</span> Could have
picked: Torii Hunter (20) Jason Varitek (21) Scott Rolen (46) Matt
Clement (86)</p>
<p>Not a particularly damning draft for the Orioles, although either of
the next two picks would have turned out a lot better than Jay
Powell.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1994</span>: Did not pick due to
losing their draft slot to the Mets for the Sid Fernandez signing.
However, they did have a pick in the 2nd round at #54 choosing
first-baseman Tommy Davis. Could have picked: A.J. Pierzynski (71) Aaron
Boone (72) Scott Podsednik (85) Mike Hampton (100)</p>
<p>Had they kept their draft pick that year, they quite possibly could
have landed: Terrence Long (20 - the actual pick used by the Mets) Jay
Payton (27) Troy Glaus (37)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1995</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">21st pick - Alvie Shepherd</span> Could have
picked: Michael Barrett (28) Mark Bellhorn (35) Carlos Beltran (49 -
Just 2 picks before their 2nd round pick!!!) Sean Casey (53 - Just 2
picks after their 2nd round pick!!!)</p>
<p>Missing out on both Beltran and Casey really hurts from a 20/20
hindsight perspective.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1996</span>: Did not pick due to
losing their draft slot to the Blue Jays for the Roberto Alomar signing.
However, they did have a pick in the 2nd round at #54 choosing Brian
Falkenborg. Could have picked: Jeff Farnsworth (57) Eddie Yarnall (78)
Nick Johnson (89)</p>
<p>Had they kept their 16th pick, they could have chosen: Eric Milton
(20) Jason Marquis (35) Jacque Jones (37) Milton Bradley (40) Jimmy
Rollins (46)</p>
<p>It’s debatable whether the Orioles would have been better off with
any of those players over Alomar.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1997</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">22nd, 26th, and 36th taking Jayson Werth,
Darnell Mcdonald, and Ntema Ndungidi</span> Could have picked: Jack Cust
(30) ;) Aaron Myette (43) Randy Wolf (54) Rick Ankiel (72)</p>
<p>The Orioles had 3 picks in the 1st (and supplemental) round in
arguably the weakest draft of the 1990s. As it turns out they did as
good as they could have given the slim pickings. Werth was in fact a
pretty good pick, but they eventually gave up on him too early.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1998</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">26th pick - Rick Elder</span> Could have
picked: Mark Prior (43) Adam Dunn (50) Brandon Inge (57) Barry Zito (83)
Josh Fogg (89) Aubrey Huff (162)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1999</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 34th, 44th, and 50th
- Mike Paradis, Richard Stahl, Larry Bigbie, Keith Reed, Joshua Cenate,
Scott Rice, and Brian Roberts</span> Could have picked: Jason Jennings
(16) Casey Fossum (48) Carl Crawford (52) Justin Morneau (98) Hank
Blalock (105) Kevin Mench (118) Albert Pujols (402)</p>
<p>With 7 picks of the first 50, the Orioles managed to get a potential
star in Brian Roberts. Prior to the 2005 season, it really looked like
the Orioles blew it big time with this draft; thankfully B-Rob managed
to look like the second coming of Roberto Alomar. Larry Bigbie may turn
out to be a serviceable player, but his time is running out. Crawford,
Morneau, and Blalock sure would look nice in Orioles informs… oh
well.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2000</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">14th and 32nd picks - Beau Hale and Tripper
Johnson</span> Could have picked: Chase Utley (15) Billy Traber (16)
Aaron Heilman (31) Xavier Nady (49) Laynce Nix (124)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2001</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">7th, 19th, and 31st – Chris Smith, Mike
Fontenot, and Bryan Bass</span> Could have picked: John Van Benschoten
(8) Casey Kotchman (13) John-Ford Griffin (23) Bobby Crosby (25) Dallas
McPherson (57)</p>
<p>Having 3 of the first 31 picks should have produced something right?
Well it turned out to produce nothing… literally.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2002</span>: <span
style="font-style: italic">4th pick - Adam Loewen</span> Could have
picked: Prince Feilder (7) Khalil Greene (13) Scott Kazmir (15) Nick
Swisher (16)</p>
<p>The true result of this draft remains to be seen, but I am among the
(higly) skeptical.</p>
And there you are; an enumeration of the past 12 drafts by the Orioles
including their actual picks and who the should/could have picked. In
case you are wondering; if the team had picked optimally and been able
to sign their picks, today’s lineup could be:
<pre>P - Mike MussinaP - Matt ClementP - Mike HamptonP - Mark PriorP - Eric Bedard

C  - Jason Kendall, Michael Barrett1B - Todd Helton2B - Mark Bellhorn, Brian Roberts3B - Hank BlalockSS - Derek JeterLF - Manny RamirezCF - Carlos BeltranRF - Albert PujolsDH - Adam Dunn</pre>
<p>Of course they would also have a payroll twice that of the Yankees.
