<a href="http://os.newsforge.com/os/05/01/25/1430222.shtml">NewsForge | Running Windows viruses with Wine</a>: "It just isn't fair that Windows users get all the viruses. I mean really, shouldn't Linux users be in on the fun as well? Well... thanks to the folks running the Wine project, Linux users can 'catch the virus bug' too -- sort of.
