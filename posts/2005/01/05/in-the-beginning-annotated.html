<p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~android606/commandline/index.html">The
Command Line In 2004</a>: “About twenty years ago Jobs and Wozniak, the
founders of Apple, came up with the very strange idea of selling
information processing machines for use in the home. The business took
off, and its founders made a lot of money and received the credit they
deserved for being daring visionaries. But around the same time, Bill
Gates and Paul Allen came up with an idea even stranger and more
fantastical: selling computer operating systems. This was much weirder
than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak. A computer at least had some sort of
physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could open it up and plug
it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had no tangible
incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the disk was,
in effect, nothing more than the box that the OS came in. The product
itself was a very long string of ones and zeroes that, when properly
installed and coddled, gave you the ability to manipulate other very
long strings of ones and zeroes. Even those few who actually understood
what a computer operating system was were apt to think of it as a
fantastically arcane engineering prodigy, like a breeder reactor or a
U-2 spy plane, and not something that could ever be (in the parlance of
high-tech) ‘productized.’” <br /> <br />Neal Stephenson’s “In the
Beginning was the Command Line” updated for 2004. <br />-m <br /></p>
