<a href="http://paulgraham.com/hs.html">What You'll Wish You'd Known</a>: "Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what <img src="http://www.poster.net/simpsons/simpsons-homer---doh---popart-4003143.jpg" height="150" width="100" align="right"> they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good."

<br /><font class="comment">Paul Graham's latest entry is as astounding as ever, this time focusing on the simple question, <i>What do you wish someone had told you in high school</i>.  Personally, I really connect with the following:
<br />
<br /><i>I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends-- that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal. No matter how much you like chocolate cake, you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it.</i>

<br /><img src="http://www.funnycomedymovies.com/davechapelle_opt.jpg" width="120" height="90" align="left">I still tend to struggle with this at the age of 29. 
<br />
<br /><i>I didn't realize exactly what was happening to us, but I smelled a major rat. And so I just gave up. Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?</i>
<br />
<br />I would be fooling myself if I did't admit that I utterly gave up trying in high school.  I often reflect back on my rationale for never doing homework.  That's not to say that I never turned in homework; of course I did.  Instead, my daily routine consisted of attending a given class, quickly pumping out the due homework for the next class, and then spending the rest of said class pretending to read my book but actually sleeping.  How could I get away with this?  It seems that the answer to this question lies in the nature of high school.  That is, it turns out that the work due in school were empty products.  Essentially, I went through 4 years of high school submitting the equivalent of hundreds of "Hello World" programs -- a product -- although not particularly useful or imaginative.  And you know, the funniest part of the matter is that the teachers expected nothing more.  As long as the answers were correct most of the time, then it really didn't matter if any true learning had occurred.  I always dreamed about what it might be like in one of the AP classes.  In my mind they involved Edward James Olmos talking openly with their students about earth-shaking math problems, but most likely it was the same situation... with slightly more difficult multiple choice questions.  It wasn't until I finally got to college and a professor asked my opinion on Aristotle that school became interesting.  It seemed that it was no longer about what the right answers were -- it was about what I thought they were (of course this broke down eventually, which led to my pursuit of computer science full-time -- but that is a story for another day).
<br />
<br /><i>Instead treat school as a day job.</i>
<br />
<br />I most certainly took this approach to school.  Often it seemed as if I used school as a place to catch up on my sleep so that I would be energized enough to ride my skateboard, play with my computer, and play baseball.  I can't begin to imagine how many hours I spent doing one of those three things.  I would play baseball from school's end until game's end, then mess around with the computer for hours, and then sneak out of the house at night to ride my skateboard every day.  Luckily for me, the daily pursuit of these activities paid of in one respect as I now make my living messing around with computers every day (sadly, I never did turn <img src="http://img.mp3spy.ru/images/2004020121211835234_1.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="left"> out to be the next Ryne Sandberg or Animal Chin).  
<br />
<br /><i>It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it can take years to figure out what a subject is really about. To take an extreme example, consider math. Most people think they hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name "mathematics" is not at all like what mathematicians do.</i>
<br />
<br />Programming is the same as mathematics.  Most people would say that it is a difficult pursuit, and I would certainly agree with them.  However, what makes person A a great programmer and person B substandard or horrible is not necessarily measured in intelligence.  Instead, I would imagine that person A simply loves programming much more than person B.  In order to be good at programming, one must understand an old saw: practice makes perfect (or in this case, practice makes less-bad).  The difference between person A and B is that the countless hours of practice seem like an incredible chore to the latter, and passes unnoticed (and is actually longed for) to the former.  Typing in examples from books based on "Hello World" is not what programming is about.  True programming involves doing something that no one has ever done before, every time.  Person <img src="http://galactic.to/azb9152a/grey_1.jpg" width="121" height="185" align="center"> A has figured this out.
<br />
<br /><i>The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant things. And especially about what other people thought of them.</i>
<br />
<br />In reality, this is probably my biggest regret from my high school years.  My population of people who influenced me in those days seemed almost infinite.  However, it seems that the number of people whose opinions I care about today is probably 5.
<br />
<br /><i>What you learn in even the best high school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college.</i>
<br />
<br />As far as computer science goes, the same can be said for the relationship between the "real world" (including jobs, personal projects, oss) and college.
