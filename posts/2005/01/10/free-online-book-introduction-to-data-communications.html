<p><a href="http://www.techbooksforfree.com/intro_to_data_com/intro.html#Introduction">Introduction
to Data Communications</a>: “This book was written over a period of five
years in my spare time while consulting at the Southern Alberta
Institute of Technology (SAIT) for various academic departments. Some of
the material is reprints of articles that I have written for the Linux
Gazette. <br /> <br />When I started consulting in 1994, there were very
few books that explored data communications for network computing. The
books that I read on data communications only gave a partial view of the
‘big picture’ and tended to assume that the reader had previous
knowledge of networking and data communications. <br /> <br />I’ve tried
to sort out the confusing issues in this book and to focus on only the
topics of the ‘moment’. I’ve been successful in the classroom with this
approach and hope that you find it meaningful too. I find that most
books on the Linux operating system do not cover the data communications
aspects of networking. The purpose of this book is to fill this void and
introduce the concepts of data communication with a slight leaning
towards the Linux operating system.” <br /> <br />-m <br /></p>
