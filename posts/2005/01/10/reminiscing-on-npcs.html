<p>I was the DM of a 2 year campaign that didn’t survive the onslaught
of puberty coupled with driver’s licenses. While the campaign never
completed, there were memorable times that tend to find their way into
my day thoughts to this day. Among them are some of the more memorable
NPCs that populated my universe; among them include: <br />
<br /><b>Anahd Swaganaga</b> <br /><i>Human Barbarian</i> <br />A
blatant ripoff of Robert Howard’s Conan mixed with a bit of Arnold’s
movie version thrown in for good measure. He was on a perpetual quest to
rescue his daughter from the clutches of his tribe’s insane medicine
man. As a result he had become a bit of a hypochondriac, constantly
believing that he had been poisoned and/or cursed by the minions of his
nemesis. He tended to speak only in catch-phrases. Finally, he possessed
a magical loin-cloth -3 to AC, providing a guaranteed saving throw
versus groin-shots (you’d be surprised how often 14 year old boys will
try for that). <br /> <br /><b>Spanky Whizzleteet</b> <br /><i>Gnomish
(class forgotten)</i> <br />Spanky was the mayor of a small gnomish
hamlet. He provided refuge for the group of PCs for a time in exchange
for their help in “taking care of a little leprechaun problem.” At the
time my PCs were more eager to dive into a full-on assault against the
leprechauns then I had hoped, and were thus summarily waxed in an
embarrassing manner (one of which became permanently color-blind while
another forever required checks against fear at the sight of mushrooms).
Because of the embarrassing defeat at the hands of the leprechauns, the
villagers impeached Spanky and cast out the PCs. Because of his
downfall, Spanky swore vengeance on the party (although he never made
another appearance before the campaign dissolved). <br />
<br /><b>Lemmy</b> <br /><i>Half-Orc Bard</i> <br />Lemmy was based on
the lead singer of Motorhead and spent his time singing crass songs in
Bars and starting fights with patrons. On one occasion he did so with
the party and was defeated quite easily. Impressed by the exceptional
cruelty shown him by a certain warrior in the party, he pledged his
sword-arm to the completion of a certain quest (details foggy). He
traveled with the party for a time, but sadly his masochistic tendencies
didn’t translate very well from the cozy confines of his local bar to
the wilderness (although rumor has it that he died with a smile on his
face). <br /> <br />-m <br /> <br /> <br /></p>
