I was the DM of a 2 year campaign that didn't survive the onslaught of puberty coupled with driver's licenses.  While the campaign never completed, there were memorable times that tend to find their way into my day thoughts to this day.  Among them are some of the more memorable NPCs that populated my universe; among them include:
<br />
<br /><b>Anahd Swaganaga</b>
<br /><i>Human Barbarian</i>
<br />A blatant ripoff of Robert Howard's Conan mixed with a bit of Arnold's movie version thrown in for good measure.  He was on a perpetual quest to rescue his daughter from the clutches of his tribe's insane medicine man.  As a result he had become a bit of a hypochondriac, constantly believing that he had been poisoned and/or cursed by the minions of his nemesis.  He tended to speak only in catch-phrases.  Finally, he possessed a magical loin-cloth -3 to AC, providing a guaranteed saving throw versus groin-shots (you'd be surprised how often 14 year old boys will try for that).
<br />
<br /><b>Spanky Whizzleteet</b>
<br /><i>Gnomish (class forgotten)</i>
<br />Spanky was the mayor of a small gnomish hamlet.  He provided refuge for the group of PCs for a time in exchange for their help in "taking care of a little leprechaun problem."  At the time my PCs were more eager to dive into a full-on assault against the leprechauns then I had hoped, and were thus summarily waxed in an embarrassing manner (one of which became permanently color-blind while another forever required checks against fear at the sight of mushrooms).  Because of the embarrassing defeat at the hands of the leprechauns, the villagers impeached Spanky and cast out the PCs.  Because of his downfall, Spanky swore vengeance on the party (although he never made another appearance before the campaign dissolved).
<br />
<br /><b>Lemmy</b>
<br /><i>Half-Orc Bard</i>
<br />Lemmy was based on the lead singer of Motorhead and spent his time singing crass songs in Bars and starting fights with patrons.  On one occasion he did so with the party and was defeated quite easily.  Impressed by the exceptional cruelty shown him by a certain warrior in the party, he pledged his sword-arm to the completion of a certain quest (details foggy).  He traveled with the party for a time, but sadly his masochistic tendencies didn't translate very well from the cozy confines of his local bar to the wilderness (although rumor has it that he died with a smile on his face).
