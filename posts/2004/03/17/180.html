<p><b>Dean’s Foot… Dean’s Mouth… Reunited.</b> <br />It appears that
once again the foot of Howard Dean has been inserted firmly into his
mouth. While the last instance (yeeeargh!) was certainly not a big deal
to myself, it inevitably ruined his presidential campaign. However this
time, his implication that George Bush was responsible for the tragedy
in Spain may prove to hurt Kerry’s campaign. I understand that Dean has
qualified his statement by implying that he was merely repeating what
was said by suspects (be they Salafia Jihadia, the Moroccan Islamic
Combatant Group, Ansar al-Islam, or TBD) of the perpetrators, however,
that explanation will NEVER fly for the majority of Americans. Howard
Dean repeating an implication is just as good as Howard Dean devising it
himself. He is viewed as a fervent anti-Bush extremist thanks to some
pointed (and brilliant, I must admit) spin from the right. I feel that
Dean’s endorsement of John Kerry is going to wind up sour in the end,
and it’s ashamed. I hope that I am incorrect.<br />
<br /> <br />In any case, this topic brings up an interesting web of
historical context that I managed to dig up thanks to a pointer from an
extremely bright coworker. It is certainly possible, in fact likely,
that Spain’s participation in the Iraq campaign was at least a partial
motivation for the bombing occurring just a few days ago. However, there
is a more sinister angle that others have yet to explore. That is, the
bombing in Spain CAN be tied back to Al-Qaeda and OBL. That is, one need
hearken back to a very famous speech given by OBL around October 7,
2001. In that
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/strike_binladentrans011007.html">speech</a>
he was quoted as saying the following, “Let the whole world know that we
shall never accept that the tragedy of Andalusia.” Andalusia is a
section of southern Spain that was once occupied for centuries by
Muslims, but was captured for good by Christians in 1492. Also within
that famous speech, OBL draws a parallel with the taking of Grenada with
the current struggles between Jews and Palestinians in Israel. That is,
while Andalusia was consumed by the Christian state, so too is Palestine
in danger of being consumed by the Israel. This is wholly unacceptable
to OBL. As Israel must currently be punished for its indiscretion on
Palestine, so too must Spain be punished for its own on the Muslims in
the south. Let us go further back in time to October 12, 2000. On that
day the USS Cole was bombed and many US soldiers died thanks to Al-Queda
and OBL. If one were to look at a typical American calendar, they would
notice that October 12 is the celebration of Columbus day. Columbus
discovered American in 1492. The infidels conquered the Spanish Muslims
in 1492. Coincidence? Perhaps. The line between the recent attacks in
Spain, Al-Queda, Andalusia, the USS Cole, and OBL is fuzzy to say the
least, but I do not think that it should be dismissed out of hand. On
the contrary it would be interesting to explore this thread intensely to
see if it bears some credence. Certainly, such a thread may explain some
underlying motivation for the bombings in Spain, outside of imprudent
notions that Bush and Spain’s involvement in Iraq alone are to blame for
the attacks. In fact, based on my initial readings, it seems as if there
is a deeper motivation for such attacks which is centuries old.
