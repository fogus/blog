<p>Well, after two previous attempts; Yuki and I finally won ourselves a
house. It is an awesome townhouse in West Springfield, Virginia: 2
floors, finished basement, hardwood floors, deck, 3 bedrooms, 2 full
baths, 2 half baths, 2 fireplaces (wtf?!?), a car hole, and a soaking
tub (did I miss anything?). We bid on two houses before this, but lost
the first one and walked away on the second one (we actually won, but
the seller did not want us to have the house inspected… even though
there seemed to be a problem with the floor joists… uh, no thanks
dickweeds). Anyway, we are both extremely happy, but also freaking out
at the same time. The two most expensive things that I’ve ever owned are
my car and my computer… so this is a huge step. I guess it happens to
everyone when they first hit adulthood (it took a while, but I’m inching
into it), but I would imagine that it will take a while for the sting to
wear off. To be perfectly honest, I was a bit skeptical about the whole
process from the beginning. Yuki and I hate salespeople with an intense
passion, and the northern Virginia real-estate agents are far below
amoeba as far as my trust goes. Our first agent was a self-proclaimed
expert in the field with a whopping 30-years of experience as a buyer’s
agent. Of course, her advise was to forego all protection that we may
have against being fleeced (i.e. home inspections, location, lubricant,
etc…) because things like that will only serve to delay her percentage…
errrrrr… our purchase. We let her go before the party even started. Our
latest agent is an extremely nice guy, but he is a little off from the
norm. After being our agent for a few weeks, submitting 2 contracts
previously for us, and meeting us numerous times, we received a call
last night while he was preparing our bid with the question, “Uhhh,
Yuki, what is Mike’s last name?” D’OH! As it turns out, everything
turned out OK… however, the next step is the house inspection. (crossing
my fingers) <br /> <br />Anyone else have their own stories? <br />
