<p><img src="./images/dizzy.jpg" align=left>When I first moved to the
Northern Virginia area I lived with my friend Matt. Matt and I have been
in bands together since 9th grade and have easily written, played, or
covered more than 100 songs in that time. Soon after moving to Reston we
hooked up with a band called Dizzy Dizzy, played a few shows, acted like
drunken fools on stage, and promptly got kicked out of Dizzy Dizzy. Soon
after that we hooked up with a couple guys in DC named Brad and Laurent
and started a psuedo-band named Homeless Revolution (I think Matt still
owns the domain name). We had a few shows lined up, and made a few tunes
worthy of the underground (waaaaay underground) DC punk scene, but broke
up after after about 5 practices we broke up because Brad and Laurent
couldn’t stand Matt. With the help of iMovie, N-Track, a DVR, and a ton
of contrast, we whipped together a Helmet-esque video (visually) in a
matter of hours.<br />

<br />Drums: Matt <br />Bass: Me <br /> <br />Sadly WMV format is all
that survives. <br />-m</p>
