<br />Quoth Ellis, paraphrasing Alan Moore:
<br />
<br /><code>...you could go into a comics shop with a pound and come out with "a real slab of culture.  And often very good culture."</code>
<br />
<br />While he of course was referring to comic books, we can abstract from that a more general question:
<br />
<br /><code>Where can you go, and what can you purchase for $1.00 USD that is a slice of culture?  What can you purchase for $1.00 USD that can change your view of the world?</code>
<br />
<br />I remain clueless.
