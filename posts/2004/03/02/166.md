I have reached the limit of my patience with Ennetation.  In a fit of fury, I decided to write a rudimentary blog comment system during my lunch break today.  During the course of my coding I realized that others may find it useful and therefore decided to attempt to go open surce with it via <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">Freshmeat.com</a>.  As it stands, the project is in the review process and will make its mega-alpha debut within the next couple of days via this blog (it is live at the moment elsewhere, but the code is rough and needs a bath).  Hopefully, <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</a> gives me the go ahead so that work on Commentationator can begin for the betterment of mankind.  As it stands, I plan on writing the code in PHP and/or Perl with a MySQL and/or Firebird and/or Postgresql backend.  If anyone is interested in designing a logo, punching out code, or hooking me with some documentation, then feel free to drop me a line.  More details to come.
