I was contacted recently by an old friend from Chesapeake High School, Jason Green.  Jason and I spent countless hours playing football, playing baseball, talking about comic books, debating the Orioles, and harassing Ms. Calvin (another friend, <a href="http://www.thaispice.biz">Tony</a> knows what I'm talking about).  If you're reading this Jason; it was great to hear from you.
