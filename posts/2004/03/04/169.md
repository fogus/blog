<img src="./images/cerebus300.jpg" align=right> Cerebus 300 is out.  I think that I'm going to grab it, lock myself in a candlelit room, read it, and cry myself to sleep.  Un-freaking believable that it's finally over.  I'm getting a creeper just thinking about it -- I'm talking and Old-Yelleresque creeper.  Thus ends a story that I read continuously for 15 years.  I officially no longer read monthly comics -- what a sad way to leave.
