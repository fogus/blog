I mentioned last semester that I was working on a project about genetic algorithms.  The project turned out to be a smashing success, and was a blast to write.  Therefore, I present for your viewing pleasure the <a href="../files/GenewarsPresentation/GenewarsPresentation.html">slides</a> from the presentation that I gave at the end of the semester.  They may not make much sense without the accompanying speech by yours-truly, but it'll have to do.

<br /><font size="-1"><i>After a mild drubbing by <a href="http://www.charm.net/~pete">Pete</a>, I remain humbled and therefore offer the presentation in <a href="../files/GenewarsPresentation.sxi">OpenOffice</a> (password: sushi), and <a href="../files/GenewarsPresentation.pdf">PDF</a> formats, plus have fixed the <a href="../files/GenewarsPresentation/GenewarsPresentation.html">pages above</a>. </i></font>
