<p>When I was in high school I happened to be one of the few students
enrolled in my school’s computer science program (we’re talking 1989 -
1993 here). The first couple of years it was a blast. Every day for an
hour a small group met in a ‘lab’ and hacked away with the 2 or 3 Apple
][s, the single Mac SE, and the 2 IBMs with BASIC and Pascal (I could
talk all day about this class, but for now I’ll refrain). One day a
friend and I discovered a game named DND that was a simple RPG with
randomly generated text mazes where you navigated your warrior into the
depths of hell and endlessly fought random monsters. When the class
started becoming boring, Eric and I would spend our time trying to beat
each other in gold obtained, experience earned, and resulting levels
achieved. For the past year, I have been trying to find the game, but
all searches for dnd.exe have been fruitless. Therefore, I think that I
will rewrite the game myself once this semester is over. Perl sounds
like the perfect choice for such a game, although I haven’t truly
thought it through. More to come eventually. <br />-m <br /></p>
