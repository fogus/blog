<p><b>Doctor Who?</b> <br /> <br /> Doctor Who is making a comeback on
BBC television and the kind folks over at
<a href="http://www.gallifreyone.com/newstv.php">Gallfrey One</a> have
been stalking the sets and snapping photos of the shoots. The newest
incarnation of the Doctor will be played by
<a href="http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0001172/">Christopher Eccleston</a>
from <i>28 Days Later</i> (the mad military leader) and <i>The
Others</i> (the husband) fame. I am pretty psyched about the new series
having almost come full

circle with the past episodes (I’m slowly working my way through the 1st
Doctor, and then should be done). Doctor Who holds a special place in my
heart as it was the only interesting show on (besides Red Dwarf) at 2am.
During high school I would often sneak out of the house with my friends
to SK8, and was able to catch the episodes when I returned. When did I
sleep you ask? In class of course. Anyway, after I graduated I decided
not to go directly to college, but instead chose to try and make my way
in the real world. As it turns out, the real world sucks and I quickly
learned that the lala land that is college was the place for me. In
retrospect, the only real advantage of taking that year off was that I
managed to see the entire run of
<a href="http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0048982/">Tom Baker</a> episodes
during that time. Everything else was a wash. <br /> <br /> -m <br />
