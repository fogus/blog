<p>Not to be hostile, but who really cares why Bush changed his DL
number? The ‘why’ of the action can never be proven, and the solar
system will have been long engulfed by a rogue sun before we get an
honest answer. Further, Bush has an iron-clad response in his back
pocket, assuming that he would even respond in the first place: <br />
<br />“Uhhhh, I wanted to.” <br /> <br />It’s a hopeless goal to try and
tackle this ‘issue’. Can we instead focus on more important topics?
<br /> <br />How about this one: <br />
<br /><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30620-2004Feb10.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30620-2004Feb10.html</a>
<br /> <br />For those uninteresed in reading the article, it basically
says that Bush’s budget, after a ‘thourough’ scrubbing, was cut by only
0.2%. WTF?!? God dammit, I saw the movie Dave, and Kevin Kline was able
to cut that much all by himself. If the guy from A Fish Called Wanda can
pull more than $4.9 billion, then a so-called budget commitee. I wonder
how many of my tax dollars go into defunct programs? I wonder how many
of my tax dollars go into the pockets of politicians – lefties and
righties? <br /> <br />You want to know what the craziest thing about
the budget is? It doesn’t allocate a single penny to operations in
Afghanitan or Iraq. Wh wh what!?! I thought we were fighting wars in
those countries. If you were to ask why this is, the answer would be
that the funding for these wars will be determined by appropriations
AFTER the election. But why? Of course, it has nothing to do with
politics according to our elected officials, but everything to do with
holding on for a while and waiting to see what the need is for those
countries before making requests for funds. They want to wait 3 etra
months to see where they stand? OK, makes sense I guess. Oh, just one
thing…. why were they able to make suplimental appropriations on time
last time? Why should the next time take longer? Why will the military
have $0.00 to work with for 3 months? Would an even more inflated budget
hurt Bush’s chances of re-election? Oh, sorry, I forgot that this
decision isn’t political. <br /> <br />See:
<br /><a href="http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,FL_money_021104,00.html">http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,FL_money_021104,00.html</a>
<br /> <br />I suppose that the troops would be better served throwing
rocks at the enemies of freedom while pushing their tanks around in the
sand. It builds character. I suppose that when our politicians see the
troops eating soil and wearing burlap, they will determine that perhaps
$0.00 was aiming a bit too low. <br /> <br />Of course, we could always
borrow from other programs: <br />
<br /><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=542&ncid=718&e=6&u=/ap/20040212/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_iraq_war_cost">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=542&amp;ncid=718&amp;e=6&amp;u=/ap/20040212/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_iraq_war_cost</a>
<br /> <br />No problem; go ahead and borrow from my 401k. No problem
pal… I know you’re good for it. <br /> <br />Of course, there are some
who would say that the lower budget numbers are a deliberate deception:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30403-2004Feb10.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30403-2004Feb10.html</a>
<br /> <br />I wouldn’t call it a lie… it’s just good budgetary
practice. I myself maintain a monthly budget, and I know that it’s
impossible to determine how much I need for gasoline every month without
driving around and running out here and there. Usually, I just allocate
a ton of my income to the CANDY category and just borrow GAS money from
it whenever I find myself out of fuel. If I happen to run out of CANDY
funds, then I simply wait until the next month to put some money into
GAS. I can relate. I’m keeping it real. <br /> <br />Oh! By the way…
John Kerry is sooooo Anti-American because he votes against military
appropriations! What a dick!<br />
