I finally got around to seeing <b>The Passion of the Christ</b> yesterday with Yuki, and I must say that it really was not a very good movie.  That is, there is nothing inherently interesting about watching a man getting the skin flogged from his body for 2+ hours.  That being said I did not find the film to be anti-Semitic.  What I did find that there was a certain group of Jewish officials (and only a small subset) and their followers calling for the crucifixion of Jesus because he was a threat to their power.  It's the age-old story; transcending race or religion.  Very little is said in the liberal media (joke) about the endless stream of Jewish sympathizers found throughout the film.

<br />I guess the best description of this film would be that it is physically exhausting to watch.  The violence is unprecedented for a mainstream film.  I thought myself desensitized after a lifetime of watching countless horror films, but <b>The Passion of the Christ</b> took me to levels that I had never been to previously.  That is, while a film such as <b>Kill Bill</b> is extremely bloody, its stylized nature makes it seem more like a cartoon than reality.  Yesterday, I felt like I was watching a documentary of depravity.  Needless to say; I don't think that I'll be buying the DVD.
