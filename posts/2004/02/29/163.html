<p>I finally got around to seeing <b>The Passion of the Christ</b>
yesterday with Yuki, and I must say that it really was not a very good
movie. That is, there is nothing inherently interesting about watching a
man getting the skin flogged from his body for 2+ hours. That being said
I did not find the film to be anti-Semitic. What I did find that there
was a certain group of Jewish officials (and only a small subset) and
their followers calling for the crucifixion of Jesus because he was a
threat to their power. It’s the age-old story; transcending race or
religion. Very little is said in the liberal media (joke) about the
endless stream of Jewish sympathizers found throughout the film.<br />
<br /> <br />I guess the best description of this film would be that it
is physically exhausting to watch. The violence is unprecedented for a
mainstream film. I thought myself desensitized after a lifetime of
watching countless horror films, but <b>The Passion of the Christ</b>
took me to levels that I had never been to previously. That is, while a
film such as <b>Kill Bill</b> is extremely bloody, its stylized nature
makes it seem more like a cartoon than reality. Yesterday, I felt like I
was watching a documentary of depravity. Needless to say; I don’t think
that I’ll be buying the DVD. <br /> <br />-m</p>
