<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br /></span></span>To me, the best
music ever created was done during my formidable years (between 8 and
20) and the 60s. In my mind nothing can beat early Beastie Boys,
Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry,
Misfits, Dead Kennedys, Fugazi, The Doors, Bad Religion, Bob Dylan,
Devo, Helmet, The Cure, The Smiths, Neil Young, Nirvana, Tool, Pink
Floyd, Pixies, Shelter, Shudder to Think, Sonic Youth, The Toasters,
etc… That’s not to say that great music hasn’t been created since then,
it just seems to be less frequent. Therefore, in hopes if sounding less
like a crotchety old man, I present the greatest artists making music in
the recent past: <br />
<ul>
<li>
Linkin Park
</li>
<ul>
<li>
At the moment these guys are making pure gold. They have regular
rotation in my playlists and look to stay there for quite a while.
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Boards of Canada
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Ditto <br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
50 Cent
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Charming gangsta rap. Although it’s nothing that hasn’t been done
thousands of times before, it’s catchy so his name may stay around
longer than say Onyx. <br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
The Hives
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Iggy Pop-esque power chords. Yuki and I tried to see them a while back
but the show was sold out… I guess they are more popular than I thought.
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Outkast
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Where the hell did these guys come from? For a long time I thought they
were redneck metal based solely on the name and weird album font. One
day, they released a double album and I was blown away. <br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Peach
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Justin Chancellor’s (Tool) side band. Pretty good, but nowhere near the
level of his main band.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
A Perfect Circle
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Maynard James Keenan’s (Tool) side band. Much better than Peach above
and comparable with Tool itself. I saw these guys at American University
(and ran into a few ex-SMCMers: Donny and Tim) and they were sublime.
</li>
</ul>
<a name="b00004t99z7499"><span class="serif"></span></a>&lt;/&gt;
<li>
Saves the Day
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Pop-punk at its best. Yuki and I did get a chance to see these guys at
9:30 and they were quite good. We felt old however. <br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
System of a Down
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Frantic rock/metal that is shockingly good. <br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Tsunami Bomb
</li>
<ul>
<li>
This is one of Yuki’s recent favorites. The female vocalist could easily
kick my ass. <br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Sigur Ros
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Haunting Icelandic theme music for the apocalypse.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
