<b>The Return of Hikeeba</b>
<br /><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I played in a company chess tournament recently and managed to place 3rd overall (out of 10 people). I made a really bad mistake in the quarter final, losing my queen thanks to a really boneheaded move, and tried <span lang="en-US">desperately</span> to get out of that hole while time ran out. Anyway, playing really motivated me to dig out my old chess program and polish it up. However, it's been about 6 years since I wrote the code and my style and skill has changed drastically since then, so I no longer remember how it works. Hopefully I will be able to figure it out before the new semester starts.
