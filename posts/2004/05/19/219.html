<p>As I type this text in Pico, I can’t help but feel that something
isn’t right. That is, something definitely doesn’t feel right about Pico
itself. All of my life I’ve lusted after the perfect text editor, yet to
this day I remain frustrated. I’ve gone through the motions of course:
vi, emacs, vim, notepad, wordpad, abiword, pico, nano, ed, e3, elvis,
hotedit, jed, kedit, jedit, joe, bbedit, writer, electric pencil,
wordstar, golded, blah blah blah blah blah. At the moment, I seem to
have settled on Pico and Vim, but something still does not feel quite
right. The source of my itch lies in the fact that while I am a very
laid back dude in most respects, I am insuperably anal about the inner
workings of my computers and my interaction with them. Couple this mania
with the need to write code and data, and I become utterly detestable.
My computers have to be positioned a certain way, directory hierarchies
must conform to ‘the one true’ way (more on this another day), only
certain programs are allowed access, all ports are closed, and only
certain color schemes are acceptable. This behavior is sub-optimal.
Sadly I am past the point of no return and have to learn to deal with it
in some way. At the moment my only relief is in ranting. My ideal
text-editor therefore would consist of the following features, and only
the following features: <br /> <br />0) Portable. I use many different
systems running many different OSes during any given week: SunRays
running SunOS, Redhat 7.2-9.0, Solaris, OSX, Windows, NeXTStep, BSD, and
Irix. I need my editor to be available on any and all platforms. <br />
<br />1) Plain ASCII. I abhor RTF, and have absolutely no need for
something that feels the need to present html as a half-hearted
translation.<br />
<br /> <br />2) No tabs please. Granted I would like to use the tab key,
but I do not want it to insert anything but space. There is nothing more
annoying to me than opening beautifully written code and having it
appear as an eight-space-per-tab abomination. <br /> <br />3) Scripting.
I personally cannot recall the last time that I wrote a script for some
kind of automated task or another within a text editor, however this is
not due to lack of need. Emacs has perhaps the best scripting available,
but that feature is not enough to save face. Emacs is a beast… WTF is a
meta-key anyway? Should I really have to track down a Space Cadet
Keyboard just to type some text? But I digress… <br /> <br />4)
Unlimited file size. I am a bit old fashioned when it comes to debugging
code. If I wish to see the state of a running program that I’ve written,
then I tend to output a gaggle of status text at chosen intervals within
the code, and simply see on which text errors occur. For even reasonably
complex systems the files tend to get huge very quickly.<br />
<br /> <br />5) Regex. Because I tend to debug as mentioned previously,
I would also like a method for performing powerful searches within
documents. <br /> <br />6) Automatic versioning. I tend to change my
mind often. Likewise, I tend to change my mind back again. Therefore, it
would be nice to have an autoversioning program. That is, as I create,
revise, and delete new text data, I would like an automatic history of
the changes recorded automatically so that I can rollback to previous
versions or extract from then as I see fit.<br />
<br /> <br />7) Syntax coloring. Nuff said. <br /> <br />8) Column
guides. I recently saw an interesting approach where very discrete lines
were used to show how columns within a text document aligned. I want
that. <br /> <br />9) Lightweight. No bells and whistles. Please, do not
take all day to load, and please do not run at a snail’s pace.<br />
<br /> <br />I’m sure that I’m missing a few key features, but the above
represent the bare minimum. All of the above have existed in some form
or another within some editor or another, but never in one place at
once… As far as I know. I guess if I want it, then I must write it
myself. One day perhaps… One day. <br /> <br />And don’t even get me
started on hex editors. <br />-m <br /></p>
