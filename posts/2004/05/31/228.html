<p><b>Language</b> <br />We are what others say we are.<br />
<br /> <br />Perhaps it is my own narrow view of current events, but it
appears to me that when news organizations mention the name Al-Sadr, it
is almost always qualified with the term ‘radical’. While
<img src="http://www.hollandsentinel.com/images/072703/iraqshiite.jpg" align="right" alt="The bitchin' cleric">
there is little doubt that the man is indeed quite radical, it strikes
me as odd that news factories all over the world would almost
universally use such a term. Everyone seems to be in on the same
terminology in this respect. It’s almost like the craze in 6th grade
that almost every pre-teen found in the phrase ‘cowinkidink’, but I
digress. Do a search at <a hef="http://news.yahoo.com">Yahoo news</a>
and you’ll find a wide range of sources spouting the ‘radical’ line. Why
is this? CNN, The Leesville Leader, The San Francisco Chronicle, CBC,
AP, Washington Times, etc…. It’s almost universal. In fact, any time
that ANY (well, almost any) news organization refers to any terroristic
Muslim leader, they are referred to as radical clerics. I once had a
radical cleric named Karas (18 WIS, 16 INT == radical) when I played DND
in high school, but I think the definitions do not match in that case.
So I ask my question again… why? Let me throw out a few scenarios:
<br /> <br />1) There is a concerted effort to paint these individuals
as freaks, and not representative of the Muslim community as a whole.
<br />2) The one dude who controlling all of the media decided that it
sounded cool. <br />3) There is a concerted effort to warn radical
clerics to watch their asses. <br />4) My scope of the matter is
extremely limited (i.e. small n). <br /> <br /><i>UPDATE</i>
