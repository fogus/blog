<p><b>N64</b> <br />I met a guy in Dupont Circle yesterday who sold me a
Nintendo 64 system with a couple games for pennies. I always liked the
N64 at the time that the Playstation was ruling the world, but my
room-mates in college only had the PSX, so I was stuck mooching… errrr…
using what they had. At the time, the N64 however was more advanced than
the PSX, but fell victim to Nintendo’s horrible marketing, coupled with
Sony’s complete embrace of third-party developers. While the guts of the
<img src="http://n64.icequake.net/img/n64-inside.jpg" align="right">
system were superior to the PSX, the choice to use ROMs to store games
was a bad idea (and is the last system to do so outside of the GameBoy).
First, the early carts were unable to store high resolution texture maps
in ROM, therefore much lower quality maps had to be used (although later
the Resident Evil franchise used higher capacity ROMs, thus eliminating
this drawback). As a result, the maps came out extremely blurred when
displayed, thus giving the N64 a bad reputation as a system with poor
graphics capabilities (which was far from the case). While ROMs were
certainly quick loading, hard to pirate, and robust; they were extremely
expensive to manufacture, therefore driving many third-party developers
into the outstretched arms of the PSX where the CD-based games were
cheap by comparison. The N64 was a beast at its core: <br />
<br /><i>CPU : MIPS 64-bit CPU</i> <br />An extremely clean RISC
processor. Yuki and I met in a computer architecture class where we
studied the MIPS CPU from the ground up. Perhaps meeting my future wife
while studying this CPU has made me biased? <br /> <br /><i>Clock : 93
MHz</i> <br />By comparison: PSX at 33 MHz <br /> <br />Not to mention
that the N64 was the first console to have a true 64-bit architecture
(while the Atari Jaguar was first, its 64-bitness is in dispute) and the
first to support
<a href="http://www.3drender.com/glossary/mipmapping.htm">MIP
mapping</a>. <br /> <br />Where the N64 really shines however, is in the
strength of its library of excellent games. We can envision a typical
game system’s library of games as a pyramid-like structure. That is, the
very best games occupy a very small percentage of the total library. For
every truly excellent game, there are 2 very good games. Likewise, for
every very good game there are 4 good games… and so on and so forth.
Where the N64 is unique in this respect is in the fact that most of its
excellent games are among the best console game ever developed. This
diamonds include the following: <br /> <br />The Legend of Zelda:
Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, Paper Mario, Super
Mario 64, GoldenEye 007, Mario Kart 64 (multiplayer mode), Donkey Kong
64, Conker’s Bad Fur Day, 1080 Snowboarding, and Perfect Dark. All of
these games are classics, and are worth the purchase price alone. <br />
<br />The final allure of the N64 for me was the rabid hacking scene led
by <a href="http://www.dextrose.com">Dextrose.com</a>. I look forward to
geeking out on this bad-boy. <br />-m <br /></p>
