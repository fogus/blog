<b>Wonderful Wikipedia</b> <br />First there was
<a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a>, then there was
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, now my latest web obsession
is what I will call WikiThreading® or KnowledgeKnitting® or Interest
Mapping®. The tremendous site
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">WikiPedia</a> is a public domain
encyclopedia maintained by an army of volunteers. Its content is highly
threaded, and a month can easily be burned by starting from any given
page and following the links contained in the article through the links
in all further articles. In fact, my latest obsession is to build daily
trees of Wikipedia topics to try and find a trend in the things that
interest me and to expand my own knowledge base. For example, Wikipedia
recently had a highlight on its front page pertaining to Single Malt
Scotch. Since I know almost nothing about the subject, I thought I would
give it a read, only to discover new knowledge that I never would have
expected to obtain on my own. From the initial article, my knowledge
tree for the day looked like: <br />
<pre>
<br />Single Malt Scotch
<br />           peat
<br />               barley     +     Tolund Man     +     Bronze Age     
<br />                                                           Bog Bodies
<br />                                                                       Lindow Man     +     Celt Human Sacrifice
<br /></pre>
<p><br />At which point I actually had to get some real work done. A
very small tree given the possibilities; however I managed to create one
containing a high ratio of nodes to new knowledge, which is the ultimate
goal. I think I’m going to start recording my daily trees in hopes of
building a graphical representation of my mind from age 28 on.<br />
