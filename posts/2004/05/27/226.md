<b>Wonderful Wikipedia</b>
<br />First there was <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a>, then there was <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, now my latest web obsession is what I will call WikiThreading® or KnowledgeKnitting® or Interest Mapping®.  The tremendous site <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">WikiPedia</a> is a public domain encyclopedia maintained by an army of volunteers.  Its content is highly threaded, and a month can easily be burned by starting from any given page and following the links contained in the article through the links in all further articles.  In fact, my latest obsession is to build daily trees of Wikipedia topics to try and find a trend in the things that interest me and to expand my own knowledge base.  For example, Wikipedia recently had a highlight on its front page pertaining to Single Malt Scotch.  Since I know almost nothing about the subject, I thought I would give it a read, only to discover new knowledge that I never would have expected to obtain on my own.  From the initial article, my knowledge tree for the day looked like:
<br /><pre>
<br />Single Malt Scotch
<br />           peat
<br />               barley     +     Tolund Man     +     Bronze Age     
<br />                                                           Bog Bodies
<br />                                                                       Lindow Man     +     Celt Human Sacrifice
<br /></pre>
<br />At which point I actually had to get some real work done.  A very small tree given the possibilities; however I managed to create one containing a high ratio of nodes to new knowledge, which is the ultimate goal.  I think I'm going to start recording my daily trees in hopes of building a graphical representation of my mind from age 28 on.
