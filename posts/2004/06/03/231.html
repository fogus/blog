<p><b>MST3K</b> <br />I’ve been thinking about getting back into the
MST3K tape trading scene after finally watching the last of the episodes
currently in my now paltry collection. During my days prior to, and
during, SMCM I spent a lot of time trading with people and soon after
graduating I had finally accumulated every known episode (It took about
6 years of hardcore trading). However, soon after that I
<img src="http://members.tripod.com/scifimoviepage/dvd/mst3k-joel.jpg" align="right">
became very bitter with the ‘direction of life’ and in a moment of
defiance I expunged myself of almost all of my material possessions,
including my prized MST3K library. Looking back, I do not regret getting
rid of anything (and in fact cannot even remember most of them)…. EXCEPT
those MST3K episodes. Weird. I decided to restart my collection, except
that this time I am going entirely digital… a huge stack of VHS tapes
takes waaaaaaaay too much room. <br /> <br />In celebration of my
newfound desire to start anew, I plan on creating a database of every
known episode and the pieces of the whole that I currently have. I will
use MySQL and PHP and will post my progress as it takes form. Using some
online sources, some Perl spidering hacks, and 30 minutes, I assembled
an SQL script for building the first generation of the database
structure. This will most likely change as more data is obtained, but it
will suffice at the moment. I’m not entirely sure how this script will
work on other databases other than MySQL, but I’m sure with some minor
mods it’ll work fine. Use at your own risk.<br />
