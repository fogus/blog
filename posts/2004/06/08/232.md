Yuki and I have been painting the townhouse non-stop for what seems an eternity.  Yesterday our fingers were swollen from the constant gripping of the paint roller.  Today we may finally finish 2 of the 3 floors (we have made an executive decision to forget the basement for now).  Besides painting I have been attending Japanese class, preparing for the big move this Saturday, and attending a distributed development class for my company, so the blog has grown spider-webs.

<br />The following links have kept me sane for the past few days:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.folklore.org/index.py">Apple Folklore</a> (Great link!)
<br /><a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7303">Minix on Bochs on XP</a>
<br /><a href="http://myoldmac.net/webse-e.htm">Web SE</a> (one of the first Macs I ever touched)
<br />
<br />Now back to painting.
