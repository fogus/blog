<b>Head exploding in 3, 2, 1...</b>

<br />The blog continues its slide into disuse as the amount of stress increases.  We moved into our house last Saturday and have spent the entire week cleaning, unpacking, and assembling.  Today, Yuki's parents arrive in DC and spend the next 5 days with us.  I was just put in charge of a massive POC demo due in six weeks.  My Japanese final exam is on Monday.  And finally, I will be married next Wednesday.  Wow.  Yet, somehow my hair remains firmly attached to my scalp, although check back with me in a week on that one.
