<p><b>Computing Imitates Life</b> <br /> <br />In response to the
article entitled
<a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105_2-5247634.html">PCs Out Sick
More Than Users</a>, a <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>
regular pondered: <br /> <br />    <i>I didn’t RTFA (this is /.), but I
wonder what the <br />    breakdown is for diferrent[sic] operating
systems: Linux, <br />    Mac OSX, OS 9, Windows flavors.</i> <br />
<br />I submitted the following anthropomorphic response. <br />
<br /><b>LINUX</b> is that geeky guy that never takes days off, but
instead sits in his lonely office with the lights turned off pounding
out incredible amounts of code in record time. <br /> <br /><b>OSX</b>
is that hot geek woman that tries really hard to show everyone that
she’s not just a piece of meat, but instead has a brain. She never takes
off either. <br /> <br /><b>OS9</b> is that old guy on the edge of
retiring who doesn’t give a $hit about doing the job. He goes to the
doctor a lot because of cruft, complains about new technology, and talks
about the old days to anyone that’ll listen. He takes off quite a bit to
visit the urologist. <br /> <br /><b>WINDOWS</b> is that guy who managed
to get far in the company by taking pictures of the president of the
company with a goat. He doesn’t really do a lot on his own, but instead
steals most of his ideas from the hot chick and the old guy and presents
them to his superiors. He takes off all the time to play golf, visit his
mistress, and to sleep off hang-overs. <br /> <br /><b>FreeBSD</b> is
the guy that no one ever talks to. He died last week. <br /> <br />-m
