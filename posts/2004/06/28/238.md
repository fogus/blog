I want to take this moment to thank my good friend Paul for helping me out with my recent move.  He sacrificed a day of jujitsu training to help me move my endless pile of books, and for that I dedicate this haiku:
<br />
<br />Missing a workout
<br />another pile of hardbacks
<br />the dumpster beckons
<br />
<br />-m
