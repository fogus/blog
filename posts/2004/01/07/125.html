<p>Just received word from my professor that I will be able to take his
course, <i>Knowledge Engineering and Cognitive modeling</i> in spite of
the fact that I have not formally taken the prerequisite. He appeared to
be happy with my background in the matter (OO Analysis and Design).
Starting January 20, 2004 I will be immersed in: <br />
<br /><code>605.748 Knowledge Engineering and Cognitive Modeling
<br />This course provides an overview of two important
interdisciplinary areas that have become closely interwoven in recent
years with computer science and related subjects such as human-machine
systems design. The Knowledge Engineering (KE) part of the course
introduces various formalisms for knowledge representation and
organization such as semantic nets, Bayesian networks, scripts,
case-based systems, and ontologies. Methods for turning knowledge into
software are discussed, including relative advantages, disadvantages,
and boundaries of applicability of the KE formalisms. The Cognitive
Modeling (CM) part of the course centers on facilitating user cognitive
performance in complex dynamic tasks, and reviews models of memory,
learning, and decision making. A special emphasis is placed on recent
advances in modeling task comprehension, cognitive complexity reduction,
and information presentation for improved comprehension. Finally, the KE
and CM topics are brought together in discussing knowledge-based data
access and knowledge discovery in large data sets. Examples of practical
applications are used to explain theoretical concepts.</code> <br />
<br />I should finish my own projects (Bayesian and C++ kernel) quickly!
