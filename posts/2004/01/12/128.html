<p>This is probably not new information for most, but it certainly is
for me.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.issues2000.org/Howard_Dean.jpg"> <br />
<br />While I do not currently support Howard Dean, I find him to be an
intriguing fellow. Therefore, I decided to look into where he stands:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/presidential/geog.asp?Cycle=2004&id=N00025663">2004
Campaign Contributions by geography.</a> <br /><code>NY loves
Dean</code>
<br /><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/presidential/contrib.asp?id=N00025663&cycle=2004">2004
Campaign Contributions by contributor.</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/presidential/indus.asp?id=N00025663&cycle=2004">2004
Campaign Contributions by industry.</a> <br /><code>Why is it that the
computer industry provides such little support? If I had to guess (and a
guess it is), then I would say that war == technological advances (Bush
got roughly 10x more). I hope that I am wrong. Although looking at the
<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/presidential/sector.asp?id=N00025663&cycle=2004">sector</a>
totals draws a slightly different picture. While the computer industry
in general ignores Dean, its cousin the Communications industry is very
big on him. </code>
<br /><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/presidential/summary.asp?id=N00025663&cycle=2004">2004
Campaign Contributions summary.</a> <br /> <br />Here is a
<a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/speech.php?can_id=CNIP0634">listing</a>
of almost every speech/appearance that Dean has given in the past year.
It is very nice that this is searchable, although when my copy of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596005776/104-0706079-0483121">Spidering
Hacks</a> comes in, I may use it to devise a small script to rip this
stuff and mold it into a nicer format. <br /> <br />Look who
<a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/endorsements.php?can_id=CNIP0634">endorses</a>
Dean. Nothing on this list stands out as strange to my untrained eye.
<br /> <br />There are two striking omissions from Dean’s public record…
<br /> <br />1) What is his voting record? <code>This is very important
to me.</code> <br />2) Where does he stand on the issues? <code>I
suppose I could garner this from his speeches, but I am lazy and require
a concise format.</code> <br /> <br />Any help on the above holes would
be very appreciated. <br /> <br />UPDATE: I just found a great site
called <a href="http://www.issues2000.org">issues2000.org</a> (it is
current) that provides a
<a href="http://www.issues2000.org/Howard_Dean.htm">pithy format on
Dean</a> for impatient people like myself. I will have to wade through
this information more thoroughly, but a surface scan makes him out to be
a much better candidate than I initially imagined. Time will tell
however. <br /> <br /><i>Next up… Al Sharpton</i> <br /> <br />-m <br />
