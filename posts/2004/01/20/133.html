<b><a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/16225.htm">New York
Post Online Edition: news</a></b> <br /> <br />“It also raised fresh
questions about Dean’s temperament when he launched into a screaming,
clenched-teeth rant before his supporters after the vote count.” <br />
<br />What is reported becomes reality. As I grow older, reality of the
world in which I live hits me much more often than as a young’in. For
example, I was once naive enough to believe that the media’s primary
role was to report the news. As I inch closer to retirement, it has
truly started to dawn on me that the media often prefers to make the
news rather than simply report it. Howard Dean’s speech last night was
reported as ranting, therefore it most certainly WAS (contrary to those
such as myself that actually watched it live and unedited). I can’t help
but harken back to a drunken (or at least buzzed) conversation that Rob
and I had about public perception and its ability to define who we
are.<br />
<br /> <br />“Rolling up his shirt sleeves and shrieking so loud that
his voice cracked, a raging Dean rallied his supporters with forced
optimism and a pugilistic tone that stood in contrast to the formal
upbeat speeches by his opponents.” <br /> <br />Call me crazy, but I do
believe that the phrase “We will not give up” is a little upbeat. <br />
<br />Yahoo news has an article entitled,
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=694&u=/ap/20040120/ap_on_el_pr/dean_7&printer=1">Dean
Blames Third-Place Finish on Attacks</a>. <br /> <br />I assume that
they are referring to the quotes, “We were pretty much the target of
everybody for a long time,” and “And it’s hard to sustain that.” <br />
<br />Sounds like Dean is punching it in doesn’t it? Poor Dean! So
persecuted! He was robbed! Of course, the
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0401/19/lkl.00.html">full
transcript</a> reads, “DEAN: Well, that was the problem, we were way
ahead, and when you’re way ahead people decide you’re the target, and we
were pretty much the target of everybody for a long time, and it was
hard to sustain that. But we did sustain it, and we got our ticket
punched in New Hampshire and that’s what matters.” While it certainly
sounds like he points to the attacks as a factor, maybe these attacks
were in line. I give the following picture as evidence… <br /> <br />

<p><br /> <br />I would like to add fuel to this fire… during his speech
I swore that I was able to discern the following: <br /> <br />And we’re
going to win in Massachusetts! <br /><i>CROWD: Seig Heil!</i> <br />
<br />And North Carolina! <br /><i>CROWD: Seig Heil!</i> <br />
<br />And Missouri! <br /><i>CROWD: Seig Heil!</i> <br /> <br />And
Arkansas! <br /><i>CROWD: Seig Heil!</i> <br /> <br />And Connecticut!
<br /><i>CROWD: Seig Heil!</i> <br /> <br />And New York!
<br /><i>CROWD: Seig Heil!</i> <br /> <br />And Ohio! <br /><i>CROWD:
Seig Heil!</i> <br /> <br />Prediction: <b>Rush Limbaugh will do this
exact bit TODAY.</b> <br /> <br />-m <br /></p>
