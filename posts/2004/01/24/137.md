<a href="http://www.morphos.net/">MorphOS</a> is perhaps the third-best operating system for the PowerPC architecture behind <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">OSX</a> and <a href="http://www.yellowdoglinux.com/">YDL</a> (even better than my baby <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/">NetBSD</a>, which doesn't really take full advantage of the dual CPU platforms).  In general, MorphOS will cost a bit of coin, but it runs a ton of Amiga applications natively via an interesting JIT infrastructure and the GUI is quite beautiful.
