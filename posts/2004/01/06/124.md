In one of Apple's more brazen examples of chicanery to date; the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/">iPod Mini</a> was released.  It is 2/3 the size and weight of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod">low-end iPod</a>, holds 1/4th the amount of data, and is yet 83% of its cost.  Am I missing something here?  Oh yeah, it is also green or pink or gold or whatever.  Also, the underlying technology is flash-based instead of hard-disk, but for one who has owned an iPod in the past, this means fuck-all.  Do yourself a favor; wait.
