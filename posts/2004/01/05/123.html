<br /> <br /><b>and finally… the spirit of Modus Ponens:</b> <br />
<br />Achilles had overtaken the Tortoise, and had seated himself
comfortably on its back. <br /> “So you’ve got to the end of our
race-course?” said the Tortoise. “Even though it DOES consist of an
infinite series of distances? I thought some wise acre or other had
proved that the thing couldn’t be done?” <br /> “It CAN be done,” said
Achilles. “It HAS been done! Solvitur ambulando. You see the distances
were constantly DIMINISHING; and so–” <br /> “But if they had been
constantly INCREASING?” the Tortoise interrupted. “How then?” <br />
“Then I shouldn’t be here,” Achilles modestly replied; “and YOU would
have got several times round the world, by this time!” <br /> “You
flatter me—FLATTEN I mean,” said the Tortoise; “for you ARE a heavy
weight, and NO mistake! Well now, would you like to hear of a
race-course, that most people fancy they can get to the end of in two or
three steps, while it REALLY consists of an infinite number of
distances, each one longer than the previous one?” <br /> “Very much
indeed!” said the Grecian warrior, as he drew from his helmet [few
Grecian warriors possessed POCKETS in those days] an enormous note-book
and pencil. “Proceed! And speak SLOWLY, please! SHORTHAND isn’t invented
yet!” <br /> “That beautiful First Proposition by Euclid!” the Tortoise
murmured dreamily. “You admire Euclid?” <br /> “Passionately! So far, at
least, as one CAN admire a treatise that won’t be published for some
centuries to come!” <br /> “Well, now, let’s take a little bit of the
argument in that First Proposition–just TWO steps, and the conclusion
drawn from them. Kindly enter them in your note-book. And in order to
refer to them conveniently, let’s call them A, B and Z:– <br /> <br />
[A] Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other. <br />
[B] The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the
same. <br /> [Z] The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other.
<br /> <br /> Readers of Euclid will grant, I suppose, that Z follows
logically from A and B, so that any one who accepts A and B as true,
MUST accept Z as true?” <br /> “Undoubtedly! The youngest child in a
High School–as soon as High Schools are invented, which will not be till
some two thousand years later– will grant THAT!” <br /> “And if some
reader had NOT yet accepted A and B as true, he might still accept the
SEQUENCE as a VALID one, I suppose?” <br /> “No doubt such a reader
might exist. He might say, ‘I accept as true the Hypothetical
Proposition that, IF A and B are true, Z must be true; but I DON’T
accept A and B as true.’ Such a reader would do wisely in abandoning
Euclid, and taking to football.” <br /> “And might there not ALSO be
some reader who would say ‘I accept A and B as true, but I DON’T accept
the Hypothetical’?” <br /> “Certainly there might. HE, also, had better
take to football.” <br /> “And NEITHER of these readers,” the Tortoise
continued, “is AS YET, under any logical necessity to accept Z as true?”
<br /> “Quite so,” Achilles assented. <br /> “Well, now, I want you to
consider ME as a reader of the SECOND kind, and to force me, logically,
to accept Z as true.” <br /> “A Tortoise playing football would be–”
Achilles was beginning. <br /> “–an anomaly, of course,” the Tortoise
hastily interrupted. “Don’t wander from the point. Let’s have Z first,
and football afterwards.” <br /> “I’m to force you to accept Z, am I?”
Achilles said musingly. “And your present position is that you accept A
and B, but you DON’T accept the Hypothetical–” <br /> “Let’s call it C,”
said the Tortoise. <br /> “but—you DON’T accept <br /> <br /> [C] If A
and B are true, Z must be true.” <br /> <br /> “That is my present
position,” said the Tortoise. <br /> “Then I must ask you to accept C.”
<br /> “I’ll do so,” said the Tortoise, “as soon as you’ve entered it in
that notebook of yours. What else have you got in it?” <br /> “Only a
few memoranda,” said Achilles, nervously fluttering the leaves: “a few
memoranda of–of the battles in which I have distinguished myself!”
<br /> “Plenty of blank leaves, I see!” the Tortoise cheerily remarked.
“We shall need them ALL!” [Achilles shuddered.] “Now write as I
dictate:– <br /> <br /> [A] Things that are equal to the same are equal
to each other. <br /> [B] The two sides of this Triangle are things that
are equal to the same. <br /> [C] If A and B are true, Z must be true.
<br /> [Z] The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other.”
<br /> <br /> “You should call it D, not Z,” said Achilles. “It comes
NEXT to the other three. I you accept A and B and C, you must accept Z.”
<br /> “And why must I?” <br /> “Because it follows LOGICALLY from them.
If A and B and C are true, Z MUST be true. You can’t dispute THAT, I
imagine?” <br /> “If A and B and C are true, Z must be true,” the
Tortoise thoughtfully repeated. “That’s ANOTHER Hypothetical, isn’t it?
And, if I failed to see its truth, I might accept A and B and C, and
STILL not accept Z, mightn’t I? <br />”You might,” the candid hero
admitted; “though such obtuseness would certainly be phenomenal. Still,
the event is POSSIBLE. So I must ask you to grant ONE more
Hypothetical.” <br /> “Very good, I’m quite willing to grant it, as soon
as you’ve written it down. We will call it <br /> <br /> [D] If A and B
and C are true, Z must be true. <br /> <br />Have you entered that in
your note-book?” <br /> “I HAVE!” Achilles joyfully exclaimed, as he ran
the pencil into its sketch. “And at last we’ve got to the end of this
ideal race-course! Now that you accept A and B and C and D, OF COURSE
you accept Z.” <br /> “Do I?” said the Tortoise innocently. “Let’s make
it quite clear. I accept A and B and C and D. Suppose I STILL refused to
accept Z?” <br /> “Then Logic would take you by the throat, and FORCE
you to do it!” Achilles triumphantly replied. “Logic would tell you,
‘You can’t help yourself. Now that you’ve accepted A and B and C and D,
you MUST accept Z!’ So you’ve no choice, you see.” <br /> “Whatever
LOGIC is good enough to tell me is worth WRITING DOWN,” said the
Tortoise. “So enter it in your book, please. We will call it <br />
<br /> [E] If A and B and C and D are true, Z must be true. <br />
<br />Until I’ve granted THAT, of course I needn’t grant Z. So it’s
quite a NECESSARY step, you see?” <br /> “I see,” said Achilles; and
there was a touch of sadness in his tone. <br /> Here the narrator,
having pressing business at the Bank, was obliged to leave the happy
pair, and did not again pass the spot until some months afterwards. When
he did so, Achilles was still seated on the back of the much-enduring
Tortoise, and was writing in his notebook, which appeared to be nearly
full. The Tortoise was saying, “Have you got that last step written
down? Unless I’ve lost count, that makes a thousand and one. There are
several millions more to come. And WOULD you mind, as a personal favor,
considering what a lot of instruction this colloquy of ours will provide
for the Logicians of the Nineteenth Century–WOULD you mind adopting a
pun that my cousin the Mock-Turtle will then make, and allowing yourself
to be renamed TAUGHT-US?” <br /> “As you please,” replied the weary
warrior, in the hollow tones of despair, as he buried his face in his
hands. “Provided that YOU, for YOUR part, will adopt a pun the
Mock-Turtle never made, and allow yourself to be re-named A KILL-EASE!”
