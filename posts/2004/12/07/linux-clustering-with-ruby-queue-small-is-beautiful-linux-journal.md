No scheduler, no process migration, no central controller, no kernel mods--simply a collection of compute nodes working as fast as possible to complete a list of tasks. But there was one big question: was accessing an NFS-mounted queue concurrently from many nodes possible to do safely? Armed with my favorite development tools--a brilliant IDE named Vim and the Ruby programming language--I aimed to find out."
