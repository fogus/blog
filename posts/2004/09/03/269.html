<p><strong> Delial </strong></p>
<p>In the book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375420525/modusponens-20">House
of Leaves</a> (once again, thank you
<a href="http://blog.founddrama.net">Rob</a> the protagonist of the
<em>Navidson Record</em>, Will Navidson, is haunted by a photo that he
took earlier in his career as a photographer named Delial. The Delial
photo almost certainly hearkens back to a truly haunting photo (shown
below) taken by Kevin Carter during his work in Sudan. The photo of a
child barely alive, starving to death, while being stalked by a vulture
searching for carrion earned Carter worldwide fame and ultimately a
Pulitzer Prize. However, shortly after his whirlwind celebrity Kevin
Carter would take his own life over perhaps the very source of that very
fame. Only two months after receiving his Pulitzer, Kevin Carter would
be found dead in South Africa from self-inflicted carbon monoxide
poisoning and a note reading, “The pain of life overrides the joy to the
point that joy does not exist.”

Kevin Carter was a perfectionist with an ideal that prevented him from
ever believing that his work was worthwhile. Kevin Carter possessed a
reflective lucidity that often haunts those who narrowly escape death,
as well as a terrible drug addiction meant to stiffle said lucidity.
There are countless stories of men surviving death and mutilation during
war while friends mear feet away lose life and limb time and again
ending their lives as the question, “Why me?” echoes perpetually in
their minds – and the story of Kevin Carter is no different. Given what
is known of Kevin Carter and his life, perhaps there was no other way
for his story to end. In the end, Kevin Carter could no longer view his
violent world with the eyes of a camera and its endless pursuit of
capturing the proper contrast of dead grey flesh to bright blood red.
Kevin Carter eventually viewed the carnage with human eyes, and the
world is minus one more genius.</p>
