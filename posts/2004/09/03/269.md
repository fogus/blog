<strong> Delial </strong>

In the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375420525/modusponens-20">House of Leaves</a> (once again, thank you <a href="http://blog.founddrama.net">Rob</a> the protagonist of the <em>Navidson Record</em>, Will Navidson, is haunted by a photo that he took earlier in his career as a photographer named Delial.  The Delial photo almost certainly hearkens back to a truly haunting photo (shown below) taken by Kevin Carter during his work in Sudan.  The photo of a child barely alive, starving to death, while being stalked by a vulture searching for carrion earned Carter worldwide fame and ultimately a Pulitzer Prize.  However, shortly after his whirlwind celebrity Kevin Carter would take his own life over perhaps the very source of that very fame.  Only two months after receiving his Pulitzer, Kevin Carter would be found dead in South Africa from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning and a note reading, "The pain of life overrides the joy to the point that joy does not exist."  <img src="http://www.modus-ponens.com/blog/images/delial.gif" align="left" />  Kevin Carter was a perfectionist with an ideal that prevented him from ever believing that his work was worthwhile.  Kevin Carter possessed a reflective lucidity that often haunts those who narrowly escape death, as well as a terrible drug addiction meant to stiffle said lucidity.  There are countless stories of men surviving death and mutilation during war while friends mear feet away lose life and limb time and again ending their lives as the question, "Why me?" echoes perpetually in their minds -- and the story of Kevin Carter is no different.  Given what is known of Kevin Carter and his life, perhaps there was no other way for his story to end.  In the end, Kevin Carter could no longer view his violent world with the eyes of a camera and its endless pursuit of capturing the proper contrast of dead grey flesh to bright blood red.  Kevin Carter eventually viewed the carnage with human eyes, and the world is minus one more genius.
