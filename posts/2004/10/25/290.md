<strong>Musical Deficiencies</strong>

I am quite proud of my music collection, however, while pondering its holes I found that it is in fact sorely lacking.  Among the critical holes listed below, I have almost no remixes of any current song in my library, thus missing some great tunes.

Missing:

White Stripes, The Hives, Mountain, John Coltrane, Circle Jerks, Black Flag (only vinyl remains), Mathew Shipp, Roscoe Mitchell, Albert Ayler, Grayboy, Fugazi (last 3 albums), Einsturzende Neubauten, Frank Zappa, Rollins Band, Teen Idles, Q and Not U, DRI, King Diamond, Plastic Ono Band, John Lennon, The Vaselines, The Raincoats, The Meat Puppets, Leadbelly, Robert Johnson, Lawrence Welk, [any IDM not named BOC], The B52s, Dead Can Dance, Sigur Ros (I lost my CDs!), Godspeed You Black Emperor, Fishbone, Iggy Pop, Ramones, David Bowie, The Clash, Talking Heads, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, [any interesting jazz -- a very weak part of my musical knowledge], The Cranberries, Smashing Pumpkins, REM, Thelonious Monk, Glenn Gould, yadda yadda yadda.
