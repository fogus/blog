<strong>Just like the good ole days</strong>

As I sit here optimizing my C++ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm">Bresenham's line drawing algorithm</a> for use in an <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> graphics <a href="http://www.minotaurcomputing.com/labyrinth.php?path=kidney">library</a> and listen to Helmet's <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/helmet/65316.html">Unsung</a>, I can't help but think back to the <a href="http://www.minotaurcomputing.com/labyrinth.php?path=gadfly">endless nights</a> of <a href="http://www.minotaurcomputing.com/labyrinth.php?path=hikeeba">coding</a> and musicking.  That's not to say that I never code, however the stuff at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing">work</a> is old hat and new challenges are becoming rare.  It's good to sit back and work through new problems.  Ahhhhh.
