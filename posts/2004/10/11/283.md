<strong>OpenGL Hell</strong>

I'm fighting with Cohen-Sutherland line segment clipping at the moment and yet still can't help but think how cool it is to again hack away at the computer figuring things out.  I really need to commit myself to a difficult project and see it through like the good ole days.

Today's hacking artists: Joy Divison, Tool, Jane's Addiction, Devo, Muddy Waters, Paul Oakenfold
