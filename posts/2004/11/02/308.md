<font size="4"><strong> PREDICTION </strong></font>

It is now 11:33pm GMT -5 and I am predicting a win for <font color="blue">John Kerry</font>.  Based on the numbers spewed forth from my Fogus Prez Picker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">Decision Tree</a> software (v.0.4.7), <img src="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~aixplore/learning/DecisionTrees/InterArticle/graphics/inverted-tree.gif" align="right" />Senator Kerry should pull this one out.  My software finds that the two most important states in determining the presidential election are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/NV/P/00/">Nevada</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/PA/P/00/">Pennsylvania</a>.  At the moment, Pennsylvania has been awarded to Kerry and Nevada is heading in that direction.  Therefore, I fully expect to wake up to a new president tomorrow.  On a similar note, my software has predicted that Ralph Nader will place in 3rd place in the voting this term.  I'm shooting for 50% accuracy with this version of the software.
