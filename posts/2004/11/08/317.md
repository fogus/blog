<strong> Farce </strong>

As the voting anomaly stories roll in, I can;t help but laugh at the complete debacle that the US voting system is.  In my district it would have been quite easy for <img src="http://images.indymedia.org/imc/washingtondc/media/image/12/diebold.jpg" align="left" /> someone  other than myself to steal my vote knowing only my address and holding a reasonable facsimile of my registration card.  Likewise, the voting system exhibits the following properties:

1) <span style="font-style: italic">No paper trail.</span> Are you joking?

2) <span style="font-style: italic">Proprietary software for vote tabulation.</span>  It would seem that in order to calculate a vote one would simply pass the tally onto some storage medium... however we would never know that because there is no visibility to the software used to do this task.  Security through obscurity... great way to run the election of the most powerful country in the world.

3) <span style="font-style: italic">No data redundancy.</span>  Failed memory card in Alexandria, VA?  Whoops, no votes cast there.

4) <span style="font-style: italic">No standardization.</span>  One machine has a dial, another a touch-screen, another has a light pen, another uses paper, another switches, blah blah blah.

5) <span style="font-style: italic">The exit polls did not match the results.</span>  Who do they have running these exit polls?  Animals, children, or worse, partisan hacks?

6) <span style="font-style: italic">The election was won by 2 percentage points.</span>  The election was won by a narrow margin and all of the known flaws of the system were known beforehand, yet the Dems rolled over and conceded without protest.  Give me a f*cking break!  Can you imagine this happening with our forefathers?  No chance.  Can you imagine this happening in even "3rd-World" countries like Venezuela?  No chance, there would have been rioting if even 2 of these anomalies would have presented themselves.  What a joke.  <img src="http://www.common-place.org/vol-02/no-04/roundtable/images/federalist.jpg" align="right" /> Perhaps the party clowns were so willing to role over because in the end their charmed existences continue unhindered... Hell, we sure aren't going to hold them accountable for anything; and why is that?  It's amazing that 60% of the voting population showed up last week, but do not expect that to happen again.  This weak display of modernization I'm sure has created a new generation of jaded citizenry.  What's the point of voting if 1) there is no guarantee that your vote counts and 2) your chosen party doesn't even care if your vote is lost or changed or even recorded in the first place.

7) <span style="font-style: italic">The voting/tallying process was unknown to the voters prior to election day.</span>  Hell, but who really cares?  It seems that as long as the KNOWN mistakes in the system are less than vote differential, then we are simply willing to let it slide.  It seems that if every single error wasn't found in the 1st 12 hours, of A NEW SYSTEM, then hell, we don't really care.  Damn, maybe everyone is right... perhaps the errors favored no candidate and they essentially cancelled each other out?  Of course, we'll never know the answer to this question because there is no mechanism for tracking... ANYTHING.

And you know what... none of this has anything to do with conspiracy theory.  It simply lies in an inexcusable laziness undermining the whole process.  It lies in a society that doesn't care a bit about an impotent voting system filled with equally impotent officials.  Why fight it when there is no ground to fight it on?  The system is flawless in that its final verdict occurs through some sort of statistical black-magic... try to prove it otherwise, I dare you.  Who really cares when really all we do is vote for the least-worst candidate from a set of partisan hacks leaning slightly one way or the other yet both catering to whomever will sell their vote for food or pills or abortions or the bible?
