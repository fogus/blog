"I have experience to work in other countries. So I know how hard Japanese business man work comparing with American people, Chinese people and Thailand people.

I never say that all foreign people is lazy. But I never hesitate to say that <a href="http://masamania.com/archives/2004/09/japanese_busine.html">Jap is fucking hard worker.</a>

Our priority is not to live, but to work.. Itâ€™s true. Every year lots of Japanese businss man tired to death while working. this is famous as overwork death or KAROSHI."
