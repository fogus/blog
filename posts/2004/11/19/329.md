<strong> Virtual Free-BSD </strong>

<a href="http://sig9.com/articles/freebsd-on-bochs">FreeBSD on Bochs | Sig9</a>: "This article is a description of my efforts to build a minimal FreeBSD system from scratch and run it under the Bochs emulator. Inspired by 'FreeBSD From Scratch' by Jens Schweikhardt, this article extends its ideas by using a file backed virtual disk, as the installation directory and harddisk image under Bochs."
