<font size="4"><strong> ERRRRRR PREDICTION </strong></font>

It is now 11:33pm GMT -5 and I am predicting a win for <font color="blue"><strike>John Kerry</strike></font>^W <font color="red">George W. Bush</font>.  Based on the numbers spewed forth from my Fogus Prez Picker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">Decision Tree</a> software (<strike>v.0.4.7</strike>^W v.0.5.2), <img src="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~aixplore/learning/DecisionTrees/InterArticle/graphics/inverted-tree.gif" align="right" /><strike>Senator Kerry</strike>^W President Bush should pull this one out.  My software finds that the <strike>two</strike>^W most important state<strike>s</strike>^H in determining the presidential election <strike>are</strike>^W is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/NV/P/00/">Nevada</a> <strike>and</strike>^W <strike>Pennsylvania</strike>^W.  <strike>At the moment, Pennsylvania has been awarded to Kerry and Nevada is heading in that direction.</strike>^U  Therefore, I fully expect to wake up to an <strike>new</strike>^W old president tomorrow.  On a similar note, my software has predicted that Ralph Nader will place in 3rd place in the voting this term.  I'm shooting for <strike>50%</strike>^W 100% accuracy with this version of the software.
