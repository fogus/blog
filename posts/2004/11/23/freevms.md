<br /><a href="http://www.systella.fr/~bertrand/FreeVMS/indexGB.html">FreeVMS</a>: "The VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system is available only on VAX and Alpha processors, and in spite of its undeniable qualities, its future seems uncertain. The FreeVMS project tends to the coding of an operating system under the GPL licence according to the specifications of the VMS systems. This operating system has to function at least on I386 architecture, PPC, Sparc and Alpha processors. It is developed using the C language."
