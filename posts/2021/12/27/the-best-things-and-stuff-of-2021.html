book on programming and programming practice written in years. Hanson
and Sussman are on fire – as if there was any doubt. I have a whole set
of notes for this book centered around Clojure that I’d love to <a
href="https://github.com/fogus/thunks">Thunk</a> some day. Until then I
will say that this is the advanced programming techniques-centric book
that I’ve wanted for years. There is a deep focus on layered program
construction, DSLs, propagator networks, non-determinism, and
degeneracy<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, all of which are little covered in
most computing texts. The schools of software architecture exposed in
this book are informed by biological systems, symbolic AI, ambient
behaviors, and the blood and sweat shed over the years developing
functional programming systems. There’s a plethora of wisdom contained
in these pages and a lot of thinking required to fruitfully mine that
wisdom to inform the construction of systems, but I think this process
will be more than worth the effort.</em></li>

options, ergonomics, and even function implementation techniques

the Dust of This Planet</a></strong> by Eugene Thacker - <em>This book
is everything and came into my life at the right moment. It’s
philosophy, media criticism, horror film commentary, found drama, metal
studies, weird, eerie, and nihil all at once. A near perfect book for my

Realism: Is There No Alternative?</a></strong> by Mark Fisher - <em>I
came to discover Fisher very late in the game, indeed, after he had
taken his own life. There is an amazing body of work to explore and
while I’ve only dipped my toe so far, I did manage to read what is
considered his seminal work. The book starts with a simple premise,
originally attributed to Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Žižek – “it is
easier to imagine an end to the world than an end to capitalism”. While
a simple premise, Fisher spends a lot of time unpacking this phrase and
tying it to our modern Western world passed through a neoliberal filter.
Numerous more reads are needed for me to really “get” this book, but I
was struck by the implied implications.</em></li>

<p>I’ve been working on a Forth variant that’s driven not by any
particular need but by a morbid curiosity to see how deep that
particular rabbit-hole goes. Specifically, I’d like to know what it
takes to build a software suite from a Forth that includes such things
as an internal database, an embedded language, a reasoning system, an
editor, and a structured programming environment.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
Over the course of the year I’ve researched each of these sub-systems
and partially enumerated the minimal-viable features needed in a Forth
to implement them.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/forth-chart.png"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/forth-chart-300x190.png" alt="" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6825" /></a></p>
<p>The chart is a fragment of that research and is currently only a
gross enumeration of every feature needed. Another pass on this list
needs to happen with an eye towards distilling features into their
composite parts, in an attempt to identify a language kernel. As a
side-effort I’ve started looking into how to implement a VM for a
Forth-like language by I’ve only scratched the surface with the mainline
interpreter. Lots and lot of research needed still.</p>
<p>While this research is happening, I’ve worked on a bit of
bootstrapping code, of which there’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>data stack</li>
<li>return stack</li>
<li>kernel functions: kpush, kpop, kdsadj, kdsaddr, kivar, krvar,
kdstack</li>
<li>dictionary construction, search, and traversal</li>
<li>initial words stack words: <code>DUP</code>, <code>DROP</code>,
<code>OVER</code>, <code>ROT</code>, <code>SWAP</code></li>
<li>initial command words: <code>BYE</code>, <code>.S</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s what it looks like so far. I’ll have something that’s
usable in 2022.</p>

<p>For 2022 I’ve toyed with the idea of sticking to certain themes on a
month-by-month basis instead of the whim-based approach that I’ve taken
so far in my life. Therefore, the themes that identified were as
follows:</p>
<dl>

<dt>Faebruary</dt>

<p>The problem with a list like this for me is that I don’t read like
this. My whole life I’ve been a very impulsive reader and past attempts
to stick to themes outside of an academic environment have died on the
vine. Maybe someone else can make something of it however.</p>

fell from fashion and were superseded by more complex offerings. That
said, occasionally a game hits the scene that hearkens back to the
bygone days of the German School and The Field of the Cloth of Gold is
one such game. The rules are simple, the game play tense, and the time
investment short. This is another triumph from the amazing <a

million times before except that it <a

even took a stab at a <a

the past but it wasn’t until I started dabbling in <a

- <em>KAMAS was early outliner software that targeted the Kaypro II
computer. It had an embedded Forth-like language that users could use to
script the application. Little survives about this language and I’d like
to remedy that somehow but even though there is an abandonware version
for DOS, it doesn’t contain the full feature set of the Kaypro version
and thus no embedded language. It seems that an actual Kaypro is needed
and somehow the KAMAS discs obtained as well. The computer part is the
easy step while the software has proven difficult to find.</em></li>

implementation techniques to add object-oriented features to Forth. It
