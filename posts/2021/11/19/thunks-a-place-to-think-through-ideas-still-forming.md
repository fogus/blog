title: "Thunks â€” a place to think through ideas still forming"

I haven't been blogging much lately because I'm currently embroiled in a years-long trend toward developing ideas and not quite formalizing any of them. While I have a lot of disparate notes around ideas it makes little sense to just put them out there for all to see[^0], yet I would still like to put some ideas out there and perhaps generate some discussion. Therefore, I've set up a Github repository called [Thunks](https://github.com/fogus/thunks) and a [discussion group around it](https://github.com/fogus/thunks/discussions) in an attempt to do just that.

As far as topics go I will probably jump all over the place but more often than not I'll land on one or more of the following topics:

* Software -- especially programming languages and systems
* Books and other reading materials
* Clojure, ClojureScript, and their ecosystems
* Games ([finite and infinite](https://www.amazon.com/Finite-Infinite-Games-James-Carse/dp/1476731713/?tag=fogus-20))
* Retrocomputing
* The software industry in general
* Life in general

*[The very first addition to Thunks are my ever-evolving notes around Clojure's core.async library](https://github.com/fogus/thunks/blob/main/studies/core-async.txt)*

Check it out.

* [Main repo](https://github.com/fogus/thunks) at Github
* [Changes feed](https://github.com/fogus/thunks/commits/main.atom) (Atom)
* [Discussions](https://github.com/fogus/thunks/discussions)

Commentary and feedback is welcome via any of the capabilities provided by Github -- but I do ask that such interactions remain constructive.
