<p>An 8-bit Spiritual (8BS) is a modern program that hearkens back to a
time when applications provided a robust experience but fit onto a
single floppy disk. Modern apps are bloated by comparison, but there are
applications that fit the spirit of the 8-bit days.</p>
<p>That said, a modern 8BS should provide a minimal set of modern
features: unicode support and Internet and/or WWW support (where
appropriate) seem like a minimal set.</p>
<p>I don’t want to limit the size of the eventual binary or linked libs
because limiting to 8-bit era floppy sizes is not necessary at this
point. I think modern-system-relative “small” is acceptable. Also, 8BSes
are programming language agnostic and both VM-bound and direct hardware
applications are fair game. 8BS is a state of mind so to speak.</p>
<p>For now, an example of the kinds of applications that I would be
interested in WRT 8-bit Spirituals are as follows…</p>
<h1 id="programs-of-yore">Programs of Yore</h1>
<p>Before I point out a few examples of modern programs that fit the 8BS
mold I’d like to take a moment to talk about a few interesting examples.
Certainly, ANY program from the 8-bit era fits the literal definition of
a constrained environment program by default but only a small subset
could be representational of the type of program that I’m after for this
post. The programs below were all constrained – but they were never
constraining.</p>
<h2 id="kamas">KAMAS</h2>
<p>KAMAS was ground-breaking outliner software originally designed for
the <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/kayproii.html">Kaypro II</a>
(eventually finding its way onto other systems) that provided a
full-fledged editor, BBS system, and internal programming language
interpreter – all on a 191K floppy disk.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kamas.png"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kamas-300x213.png" alt="" width="300" height="213" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6665" /></a></p>
<p>I’m somewhat of a fan of the KAMAS software, even though I’m only
able to run a <a
href="https://www.pcorner.com/list/WORDP/KAMAS25.ZIP/INFO/">truncated</a>
<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> version on the <a
href="https://www.dosbox.com">DOSBox emulator</a>. Even minus the more
advanced features found on the Kaypro versions, KAMAS for DOS is a solid
application; however with those advanced features the program was a <a
href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22kamas%22&amp;and%5B%5D=mediatype%3A%22texts%22&amp;and%5B%5D=year%3A%22-1%22">powerful
digital workspace</a>.</p>
<h2 id="electric-pencil">Electric Pencil</h2>
<p>Electric Pencil was the first program to implement word
processing-like features and ran on the MITS Altair on 8K of memory.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ep.jpg"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ep.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="210" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6666" /></a></p>
<p>While certainly not at the level of many word processors that came
after it, Electric Pencil set the pace for many of its successors.
Indeed, many retrocomputerists consider the now defunct Word 5.1 for the
Macintosh the pinnacle of word processing.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pce-mac-word51.png"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pce-mac-word51-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6675" /></a></p>
<p>I was never fortunate enough to use <a
href="https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-word/5x-mac">Word 5.1</a>
but it certainly seems to shine as an example of an application that an
8BS should shoot for.</p>
<h2 id="turbo-pascal">Turbo Pascal</h2>
<p>Turbo Pascal was originally released on the 8-bit CP/M OS and
contained an IDE and compiler that could run programs in memory or
compile them blazingly fast – all for $35.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tp.jpg"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tp-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6667" /></a></p>
<p>Pascal was a great language to the 8-bit era and amenable to fast
compilation but the Turbo Pascal software is famous for being a shining
example of Anders Hejlsberg’s programming prowess.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="modern-8bses">Modern 8BSes</h1>
<p>Having shown a few examples that act as goalposts for the modern
8BSes, I’ll offer a few examples of modern programs that hit the mark
set in the beginning of this post.</p>
<h2 id="redis">Redis</h2>
<p>Something like pre-clustering Redis is a decent candidate. Certainly
it’s not a floppy-sized program but it did a lot given its small
footprint. While it’s grown in scope over time, the original vision was
a sleek data-structures database that performed well, was quite stable,
and was even easy to understand.</p>
<h2 id="frink">Frink</h2>
<p><a href="https://frinklang.org">Frink</a> is a programming language
unlike any other. It is generally known for its ability to handle and
convert between a bevy of units of measure consistently throughout
calculations. For anyone who has created a complex system (or even a
simple one for that matter) that needed to juggle varying units of
measure, the complexity of the problem that Frink handles seamlessly is
staggering.</p>
<pre><code>// Levenshtein distance is a built-in
println[editDistance[&quot;kitten&quot;,&quot;sitting&quot;]]
//=&gt; 3

// Convert feet to meters
38 feet -&gt; meters
//=&gt; 7239/625 (exactly 11.5824)</code></pre>
<p>Frink requires a JVM, which is as far from an 8BS as you can get.
However, VM aside “the Frink programming language including all its
reference data, GUI, and graphics, can ship in less than 500 kilobytes
(pack200 compression).”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</h2>
<p><a href="http://bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> is
another interesting candidate.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EYAGN1XWoAUl_ss.png"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EYAGN1XWoAUl_ss-291x300.png" alt="" width="291" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6679" /></a></p>
<p>It’s a world-builder / rougelike / simulation game that is obsessive
in its approach to detail – despite its textual graphics. The game has
maintained a strict vision of providing strong-simulative gameplay by
its designers Tarn and Zach Adams.</p>
<h2 id="putty">PuTTY</h2>
<p>The final program that I’ll nominate is the workhorse terminal
emulator <a
href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>.
After 20+ years of development, PuTTY is still a 3 MB install and
provides a useful set of functionality. When you need the functionality
that PuTTY provides you REALLY need it to run well and right away. PuTTY
has been meeting this need year after year and has been rock-solid all
along the way.</p>
<h2 id="bs-systems">8BS systems</h2>
<p>Before I end I should point out the existence of hardware 8BSes. I
suspect that the Pi, Arduino, ESP32, etc. communities have a ton of
examples of viable 8-bit Spirituals to learn from. More exploration
needed on my part and perhaps a future post will tackle them in more
detail – though pointers and info about them is always welcomed in the
comments below.</p>
<h1 id="finis">Finis</h1>
<p>That’s all that I have for now. The 8-bit era has passed us by and is
not likely to ever return in the realm of the general-purpose
user-centric application. However, the <em>spirit</em> of the 8-bit
system is still something that we can strive for and sing the praises
of. The question is of course – should we?</p>
