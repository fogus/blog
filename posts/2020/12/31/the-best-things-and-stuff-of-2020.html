have a complex relationship with pg in that many of his early, mostly
pseudo-technical writings were inspirational. however, over time his

is, I’ve been posting threads and such on <a

of posts here That said, there were a few high-traffic posts on my
blog.</p>

books discovered (and read)</h2>
<p>I’ve intentionally reduced the number of technical books that I
consume, but there are a few that I “found” in 2020 that stood out.</p>
<ul>

<li id="fn2"><p>I came across Terry Davis many years ago when TempleOS
was known as Losethos. He was an interesting person to correspond with

Markovian nonsense generated by a program he called “Word of God.”<a

code writing and rewriting its guts. it’s a challenging task but not
world-shattering and i find working on it better than jigsaw puzzles.<a
