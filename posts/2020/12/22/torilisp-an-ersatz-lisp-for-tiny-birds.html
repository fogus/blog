<p>When deciding to work on a side-project three factors are needed to
transition from fancy to application: goal, motivation, and time.</p>
<p>Time is usually the biggest sticking point for me personally but with
COVID most of what I may have spent my time on this year was cancelled.
However, motivation was still a huge sticking point until I came across
a couple of projects that helped propel me forward. First, I spent some
time earlier this year combing over <a
href="https://twitter.com/maryrosecook">Mary Rose Cook</a>’s lovely <a
href="https://github.com/maryrosecook/littlelisp">Little Lisp</a>
interpreter code. Given what I knew about Mary’s previous projects it
was no surprise that the Little Lisp implementation was simple and
elegant. However, what I wasn’t prepared for was that hacking on the
interpreter turned out to be straight-forward and addictive. However, it
wasn’t until I re-discovered <a
href="https://twitter.com/wtaysom">William Taysom</a>’s old Scheme-like
language <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090625142941/http://moonbase.rydia.net/mental/blog/programming/misp-is-a-lisp">Misp</a>
that I had a form for the interpreter in mind. At the time of William’s
original blog posts about Misp I was drawn to his passion and enjoyed
the implementations of the language that he posted.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Around the same time I found Paul Graham’s original Arc tutorial <a
href="http://www.arclanguage.org/tut.txt">tut.txt</a> and used it
extensively to guide me in what to implement next.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> All
discussion about Arc aside, I definitely appreciate the clarity and
layout of the Arc tutorial and found it a great outline for a little
language.</p>
<p>Finally, as some of you might know I <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D624AQO?tag=fogus-20">dabbled
in functional programming in JavaScript</a> and even went so far as to
create a couple of libraries pushing the fringe of fp in js; namely <a
href="https://github.com/fogus/lemonad">Lemonad</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib">underscore-contrib</a>.
Some of the ideas in these libraries found their way into my own
interpreter which ultimately pushed my code away from Misp, Little Lisp,
and Arc into …something else – that something else I’m calling
<strong>Tori Lisp – an ersatz LISP for little birds</strong>.</p>
<center>
ToriLisp = Litle Lisp + Misp + tut.txt + Lemonad + underscore-contrib +
a pinch of CLJ
</center>
<p>Here’s a very small sample of the language:</p>
<pre><code>鳥&gt;  (let (x 3 y 4)
       (+ (* x 2) (* y 2)))
;;=&gt; 14

(def map
  (λ (fn list)
    (if (no list)
      list
      (cons (fn (first list))
            (map fn (rest list))))))

鳥&gt;  (map (+ 10) &#39;(1 2 3))
;;=&gt; [ 11, 12, 13 ]

鳥&gt;  ({x y | (/ (+ x y) 2)} 2 4)
;;=&gt; 3

鳥&gt;  (len &quot;abc&quot;)
;;=&gt; 3
鳥&gt;  (len {a | a})
;;=&gt; 1
鳥&gt;  (len +)
;;=&gt; 2

鳥&gt;  (read &quot;(push [1] &#39;Z)&quot;)
;;=&gt; [ &quot;&#39;push&quot;, [ &quot;&#39;list&quot;, 1 ], [ &quot;&#39;quote&quot;, &quot;&#39;Z&quot; ] ]
鳥&gt;  (eval (read &quot;(push [1] &#39;Z)&quot;))
;;=&gt; [ &quot;&#39;Z&quot;, 1 ]  </code></pre>
<p>If I wanted to present a list of features then the following list
would work:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Functional</li>
<li>Immutable access to JavaScript arrays and hash-maps.</li>
<li>Function auto-currying</li>
<li>Function introspection</li>
<li>Bottoms-out at JavaScript structures and functions</li>
<li>ML-like Refs</li>
<li>Lightweight syntax for common language forms</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in checking out the language then the <a
href="https://github.com/fogus/tori-lisp">ToriLisp Github repository</a>
has a quick start, test suite, and its own tut.txt.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Though the implementations did not make the Internet
Archive it seems. I reached out to Mr. Taysom years ago and he was kind
enough to send me the code but I hesitate to share it publicly without
his approval.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>Currently ToriLisp doesn’t have macros though not
because it would have been terribly difficult to add. Instead, I wanted
to start with functional literals and auto-currying and see how far it
could take me. I may add them at a later date but only time will tell.<a
