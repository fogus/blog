<em>Never grab food from another person’s chop-sticks using your own
chop-sticks</em><br /> There is a custom at Japanese funerals where the
bones of the deceased are passed from one person to the next using
chop-sticks and then finally being placed into the urn. Passing food
from chop-stick to chop-stick is viewed to be in bad taste.
</p>
<p>
<p><em>Never ‘plant’ your chop-sticks into your bowl of rice (i.e. so
that it looks like rabbit ears)</em><br /></p>
Again, this harkens back to a Japanese tradition where food is often
offered to the ancestors and placed into the rice like so.
</p>
<p>
<em>One bite!</em><br /> Sushi, when eaten with either hands or
chop-sticks, should be consumed with one bite. Never nibble. One bite!
Hikeeba! If the futomaki is too big for your mouth, then do not order
it.
</p>
<p>
<em>Too much soy sauce, a baka gaijin makes.</em><br /> I still struggle
with this one. When eating sushi, one should be careful not to place a
standing puddle of soy sauce in the bottom of your given dish. Instead
the amount shold be somewhere between a one-atom-thickness stain on the
dish itself and the aforementioned puddle (closer to the former).
</p>
<p>
<em>Don’t destroy your rice</em><br /> Japanese rice is made to be
sticky. This makes it perfect for eating with chop-sticks. However, it
is considered bad form to let your rice soak up so much soy sauce that
it looses the very property that makes it loved.
</p>
<p>
<p><em>Bookends</em><br /></p>
When you are about to eat: itadakimasu (ee-ta-da-key-mas)<br /> When you
are doing eating: gochisosamadeshita (go-chi-so-sa-ma-de-shta)
