<p><i>Warning: Potential spoilers below</i><br /></p>
Things are getting a little sparse on the TV watching front, but there
are a few things worth mentioning. First, Yuki and I appear to have
watch our way through Iron Chef and are starting to see repeats very
often. This has created a huge hole in our TV watching as Iron Chef was
our staple. Having lost my favorite show, I was fortunate enough to find
another equally interesting;
<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a></b>.
I had always heard good things about the show, but I never really got
around to checking it out. Thanks to the genius of DVR I have been able
to watch it almost non-stop for the past week and I am blown away. Other
than Mythbusters, there is nothing else on regular TV that I have been
able to catch regularly. However, on the “films of cinema” front it’s
been a good month. First of all, I have to recommend that anyone reading
this blog (both of you) should go out and immediately see
<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221073/">Chopper</a></b>
starring Eric Bana (of Hulk and Munich fame). Based on this performance
alone, Bana has propelled himself to the forefront of my favorite
thespians. It’s hard to enumerate why this film is so interesting, but
somewhere between the ear slicing and the final poignant scene I was
hooked eternally. Another interesting film (although less so than the
former) was the Russell Crowe film
<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105275/">Romper Stomper</a></b>
about Neo-Nazis fighting local Chinese immigrants, themselves, and their
internal turmoil. Crowe was pretty good, but for me the true star was
the conflicted Davey played by Daniel Pollock. This guy was truly the
star of the movie and should have gone on to greater heights than even
Crowe himself. Sadly, as a heroin addict, Pollock was in reality a
highly disturbed guy who decided to throw himself under a moving train
soon after the filming of Romper Stomper. Too bad. I think I watched a
few other films since my last TV post, but nothing was near as memorable
as the three I mentioned.

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;There is an aside that I would like to follow for just a moment.  In my life I have been a fan of the original Star Trek series.  I wouldn&amp;#8217;t call myself a Trekkie per se, but I would say that I am more than a casual viewer.  That being said, I had thought that I had watched EVERY episode of the original series and the animated series at least twice until I came across an episode entitled &lt;b&gt;The Conscience of the King&lt;/b&gt; about a futuristic Shakespearean actor who is perhaps more than he appears.  I loved it!  And I&amp;#8217;m not just saying that because I had never caught it before.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-m&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
