<p>For those of you unfamiliar with my habits, I am in the process of
developing my own operating system during my hobby hours (or minutes
recently). The preliminary results have been promising as I have been
able to implement a base kernel with kprint, kmalloc and kfree (with
flat mm), pic init, a rudimentary HAL, and some entropy/random routines.
The real problem so far has not been the progress but rather the lack of
vision, therefore I will take a few minutes to list out some goals and
cool features to provide via my OS.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I grew up on the Commodore 64 and loved every minute of it. Among
my favorite features were the peek and poke commands which allowed you
to set and get values of memory locations from within BASIC programs.
These functions were of course completely unprotected, thus allowing you
to put any byte into any
<a href="http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/cbm/docs/c64-memorymap.html">memory
location</a> (including video memory which would cause interesting
environment changes to occur). As a kid these were invaluable learning
tools as I could peek and poke around, mess thing up, and then switch on
and off and be back to square one in 3 seconds. Which leads me to my
next goal…</p></li>
<li><p>The C64 was an instant-on machine. As soon as the swich went down
the BASIC shell was up waiting for input. I would love to get this type
of response, but it is probably pie in the sky. However, with the help
of a fast loading kernel and some fast firmware to help out
(<a href="http://www.linuxbios.org/index.php/Main_Page">LinuxBIOS</a>
perhaps).</p></li>
<li><p>I would love to create an OS able to pool high quality entropy
for use in crypto functions. Currently, I have a few hooks in the HAL
layer to pull entropy from hardware sources (e.g. the Via C3 and C7
chips) where appropriate and to also supplemet that pool with very good
random number generators. An ultimate goal of the OS is to feed as much
non-deterministic entropy into the pool as possible. Some possibilities
might be: user key click timings, realtime clock and reference
oscillator jitter, cpu temp. etc…)</p></li>
<li><p>HAL. I love hardware abstraction layers and the problems they
prsent in design and implmentation. I am less interested in providing
portability as I am for figuring out how to provide portability. The
journey is the reward.</p>
<p>That should provide a nice start to getting a fairly complete goal
set under wraps. I will go now and try to noodle my way through these
points and expand on them.</p>
<p>-m</p></li>
