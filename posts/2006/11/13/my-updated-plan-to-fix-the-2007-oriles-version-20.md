The rationale behind the above is as follows.  The Orioles have found themselves hard-pressed to compete with many teams in acquiring top-notch free agents.  Therefore, I am of the opinion that they should instead try to stock some young talent and sign older guys who are high risk and on the cheap.  The one major downside is that any or all of Durazo/Wolf/Alou could be injured for a significant chunk of time.  Therefore, some of the younger and/or less injury-prone options below might be a better idea.  Further, with the above moves, the defense hasn't significantly improved.  In addition, the bullpen is a question mark, but I am <a href="http://blog.minotaurcomputing.com/mddc/2006/10/2007-bullpen-not-too-bad.php">fairly confident</a>, that there are anough pieces to keep it sane.
