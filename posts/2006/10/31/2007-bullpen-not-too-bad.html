<p>I have always believed that a nice bullpen is fairly easy to assemble
– even moreso than a starting rotation. Most teams have enough talent
and spare parts in the minors to put together at least an average
bullpen, however, most fail to pull candidates from an often overlooked
pool; young starters. In the olden days of baseball, a young starter
would be placed in the bullpen in order to get some time against big
league hitters and to earn a spot in the rotation. This practice is all
but lost to the dust bin of time for now good reason except that
contracts often force an organization’s hand. However, it boils down to
a choice between:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Watching a young pitcher flounder as a starter for 1-2 years</li>
<li>Picking a young pitcher’s appearances wisely for the pen</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, assuming that the Orioles decided to do something radical and
do as I advocate, then the prospects for a solid 2007 bullpen widen.
Let’s look at the potential candidates, broken into the following
categories: Proven, Reactivated, Radical, Potential, Fringe, and Free
Agents.</p>
<p><strong>Proven</strong> Chris Britton, Chris Ray</p>
<p>These guys are essentially no-brainers. Nothing to be said here.</p>
<p><strong>Reactivated</strong> Kurt Birkins, Aaron Rakers, John
Parrish</p>
<p>All three of these guys have had success in the past, but their
injury status gives cause for concern. However, if even one is able to
pull himself together, then what they bring is essentially free given
that they were non-factors last season (especially Rakers and
Parrish).</p>
<p><strong>Radical</strong> Hayden Penn, Cory Morris</p>
<p>Cory Morris has had pretty good K/9 rates during his time in the
Orioles system (9.10 in 643.1 IP) and is a perfect candidate for the
bullpen. Hayden Penn struggled majestically during his brief time in
Baltimore last season, but has put up respectible numbers in the minors.
There’s no doubt that both of these guys have talent, but they should
not be handed rotation slots based on that alone.</p>
<p><strong>Potential</strong> Brian Burres, Radhames Liz, James Hoey</p>
<p>Of the three, I would put my money on Hoey to win a spot out of
spring training, however, with the other two in the mix things look nice
for the next year or two. I would imagine that at least one of these
guys could be something special out of the pen.</p>
<p><strong>Fringe</strong> Sendy Rleal, Todd Williams, Julio Manon, Tim
Byrdak, Jim Johnson</p>
<p>All of the above have proven to be adequate, but each suffers from
one or more of the following flaws: not enough strikeouts,
inconsistentcy, injuries, and LOOGY-ness. Between the lot, I would
imagine that one may prove fruitful. However, in order to find the one
gem, a coach must be willing to devote a bullpen slot (or two) as a
revolving door where each of these guys can be swapped in and out at
will.</p>
<p><strong>Free Agents</strong> J.C. Romero, Chad Bradford</p>
<p>IMO, only one middle reliever should be bought this offseason, as
they rarely turn out to be wise investments. However, the magic comes in
picking the one guy who will give you the best for your dollar. The best
bet for me is Chad Bradford, however, he comes with a price, and that’s
his tendancy to induce grounders. That should be a good thing, however
the Orioles defense is suspect and may be better served by a guy who can
blow the ball by the hitters – That’s where J.C. Romero comes in. After
his sub-par 2006 season, he may be available cheaply and could provide
the best bang for your middle-reliever buck; he’s risky though.</p>
<p>A bullpen of: Britton, Ray, Parrish, Penn, Hoey, and Bradford may
help the Orioles gain some respectibility. In addition, with potential
gems like Rakers, Morris, Burres, Williams, and Byrdak ready to step in,
their depth may prove to shine as well.</p>
