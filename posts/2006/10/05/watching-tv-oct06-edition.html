<pre><code>                                &lt;p&gt;With the little boy in the world, TV has taken on a dull luster, however I still have a chance to check out things here and there.  Currently, my favorite show is something called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.survivorman.ca&quot;&gt;Survivorman&lt;/a&gt; that chronicles the adventures of Les Stroud.  Basiacally, he gets a crew to drop him off in the middle of the woods, or mountains, or wooded mountains, with very little equipment (the last I saw he had 5 cashews, two pieces of jerky, and a match).  It&amp;#8217;s pretty straight forward from there as he attempts to find his way out of the woods using his whits.  With my long-time obssession with living off the grid and survival techniques (although ironically, I hate the outdoors&amp;#8230; go figure), this is the perfect show to burn an hour on.  I finally got around to watching season 6 of Oz, which was fairly good, but still couldn&amp;#8217;t touch the glory days of seasons 1-3.  However, it did put the term &amp;#8220;spooning&amp;#8221; in a whole new light.  Speaking of Oz, it&amp;#8217;s interesting to see a bunch of the actors from that show hitting it big with a couple guys getting a lot of face time on &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt; and a little show called The Sopranos.  Finally, I&amp;#8217;ve been recording Heroes, but just haven&amp;#8217;t had the urge to watch an episodes yet, but I hear it&amp;#8217;s pretty good.  That&amp;#8217;s it&amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s all the TV watching I&amp;#8217;ve done since the last TV post.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
