<p>It’s times like this that I miss my great grandmother tremendously.
She was a wild old lady, approximately 5′1″ tall and no more than
100lbs. However, she had a mouth on her that would make a sailor blush.
I remember staying home with her during my pre-middle-school years and
listening to her curse at the television. She loved to watch soap operas
and would constantly cuss at the male leads as they were inevitably
cheating, lying, or plotting and she tried as hard as she could to warn
their female counterparts. My great grandmother rarely spoke about
things outside of her soaps, but there are certain things she would
discuss almost religiously. For example, every day during the summer she
would stop the snowball man and order a chocolate with extra marshmallow
and would always buy another for me (egg custard was my favorite). She
would then proceed to crush the ice in the cup for seemingly hours and
talk vigorously about the virtues of properly mixing the mallow with the
chocolate flavoring. The sound of the plastic spoon crunching the ice is
forever burned into my brain. In addition to her ice cream habits, she
loved talking about an old wrestler named Gorgeous George whom she once
loved passionately. I’m sure that there were days in her earlier years
when she would attend wrestling matches and scream obscenities at the
other wrestlers opposing GG. I miss my great grandmother, and I hope now
she is finding the peace that she never had in life. If there is a
heaven, then she’s there now hanging out with Gorgeous George. <br/>
