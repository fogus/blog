<p>The year is 1994. I was a listless young man of 18 who had graduated
from high school only one year prior and summer was fast approaching. I
had recently lost/quit my job at Sam Goody (more to come on this later)
and was working as a cashier at a drive-thru car wash (more on this
later). I had just spent the previous year living in the basement of my
parents’ home, playing in bands, blowing my money on CDs, MtG, and
concerts, and riding my skateboard 24 hours a day. Essentially, I was
doing what I had done all through high school except that at 18 I would
be considered a bum. The only productive activities that I engaged in
between graduation day and the first day of summer 1994 were to write
assembly programs on my Compaq (more to come later) and read a hell of a
lot of books. The latter however, mostly consisted of fantasy novels and
space opera. However, one day a friend handed me a book that would
change the shape of my summer and perhaps my life. This book was Walden
by Henry David Thoreau and it would mark the beginning of my fascination
with literature and be the first entry in what I like to call “The
Floating Books”. Before I begin, I should define the meaning of what a
floating book is. For the summer of 1994 I spent nearly every day
floating in the family pool in the morning while reading a book or two
before I was expected at work. The books that I read during that summer
naturally constitute the floating books.</p>
<p>Walden by Henry David Thoreau</p>
<p>Looking back on my reading of this iconic book, I have to say that I
didn’t really care for it. However, it did motivate me to continue along
the path of literature for the rest of the summer. Additionally, the
basic premise later motivated me to stay in the dilapidated camper in my
parents’ yard the following summer in order to expunge myself from the
distractions that an eternally feuding family clan bring. Finally, I
later wrote a very comprehensive essay about Walden in an attempt to win
some scholarship money, but was ultimately unsuccessful in my entry —
partially (completely) because I took a position in opposition to the
contest theme of “How the US government can help the needy”.</p>
<p>1984 by George Orwell</p>
<p>1984 was probably the most influential book that I had read up to
that point in the summer of 1994, although it would not be difficult to
believe considering that the bulk of my reading consisted of Dungeons
and Dragons manuals. I may be tempted to say that my Commodore 64
Programmers Manual was equally influential, but that is mostly in
retrospect and its influence was not felt until at least 1 year later.
After reading 1984 (3 times) I felt as if I had woken from a dream. I
can’t properly explain the feeling that washed over me after finally
reading the fate of Winston Smith.</p>
<p>A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess</p>
<p>While I had seen the movie prior to reading the book, I never truly
appreciated the dialogue of the gang until I saw it in print. It amazed
me how one could read a book and not truly understand the dialogue until
half way through. Despite this fact, I was unable to stop reading and
devoured it four times in the span of a week; each reading providing a
more detailed understanding of the story.</p>
<p>The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri</p>
<p>When I first considered reading the Divine Comedy I was a bit
skeptical of its size and poetical nature. I had never attempted to read
such a large book in my life previously (unless you consider reading the
AD&amp;D DM Guide 7 or 8 times) and was frankly imtimidated. However, I
eventually took the chance and loved it. Although I have not since
attempted to re-read The Divine Comedy since that summer, there are many
lasting images from it:</p>
<p>“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”</p>
<p>Blood and tears drinking maggots</p>
<p>Satan bound</p>
<p>The river of boiling blood</p>
<p>Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse</p>
<p>After read the epic by Dante, I decided to take a break and read the
relatively sparse Siddhartha (160 pages). However, I quickly found that
there was more to the book than I could imagine. At the time I imagined
myself as Siddhartha by the river, except my Ohm came from a pool filter
— go figure.</p>
<p>The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx</p>
<p>At the time of my first reading, I can honestly say that I hated this
book. The summer was winding down and I felt that I was wasting my
remaining time. However, it did indirectly motivate me to sign up for my
first college courses. That is, prior to reading the Communist
Manifesto, I imagined that I could never understand the Communist
Manifesto. You see, as a child of the 80s, I was taught that communism
was pure evil that wished nothing but death to all Americans. The actual
root text for communism was diametric to those ideals, and I was quite
pleased to have discovered that. As it turns out, since I was able to
understand this fact I gained me some confidence that I might not be too
blown away by college-level classes. I was only half right about
that.</p>
<p>She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver Goldsmith</p>
<p>In the final week before classes started, I was no longer floating in
the pool. However, I do consider Goldsmith’s masterpiece part of the
floating books. When one grows up with science fiction and fantasy as
their only input, it becomes immediately apparent, especially after
reading She Stoops to Conquer, that one has never really read a story
containing believable female characters. While the ending is
sugar-sweet, the body of the play was eye-opening for me.</p>
<p>I can’t do justice by explaining how the Floating Books changed my
life. I can only say that prior to the summer of 1994, I didn’t truly
understand what literature and contemplation were, but had a slightly
better idea by the time autumn came. The books mentioned above worked to
motivate me to strive for more information and thusly enroll in college
courses. There were many other factors which led to this change in my
life’s course, but the books are what will remain when my memory fades
and I lose most of my marbles. I’m sure that we all have our own version
of “The Floating Books”… the preceding were mine.</p>
