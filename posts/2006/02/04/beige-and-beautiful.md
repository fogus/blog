<p>So I was surfing on Craigslist recently and came across a post for a <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com/ppc/g3b.shtml">Beige G3 Minitower</a> for sale.  300MHz, 192 MB RAM, 8GB HD <img src="http://images.minotaurcomputing.com/icons/mac_classic.gif"/>, pennies on the dollar.  In a word perfect.  I have been looking for a cheap, low-power machine to be a Subversion server with a simple backup system resident.  My plans are to take this machine and install my old copy of Jaguar (currently installing&#8230; 2.4 hours to go).  Next I will install Fink in order to install Apache, Subversion, and its Apache plugin.  Next, I will create the Subversion repository and perhaps the viewsvn.py script (after installing Python of course).  Finally, I will create a script to backup the repository to the internal Zip100 drive and launchd it.  On Ebay I&#8217;ve seen some compatible RAM chips for around $15, so I&#8217;ll probably grab one of those to speed things up a bunch.  As I said&#8230; perfect.</p>
