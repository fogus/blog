Even though February still lives, I feel it necessary to mention a few
interesting items that I’ve watched recently in the realm of visual
stimuli. First of all, it appears that my satellite provider decided to
upgrade my service for free, so I have been able to catch a few new
shows of interest. For the first few days of the upgrade I was able to
once again catch the <strong>O’Reilly Factor</strong> and I must say
that Mr. Bill once again never failed to entertain. Love him or hate
him, you gotta admit that he’s stumbled on an interesting formula.
Sadly, (or gladly, depending on how you look at it) the inclusion of the
Fox News Network was pulled from the extended station listing and is no
longer available. However, one channel of interest remains; the
Documentary Channel. In the show time that I have been watching DOC I
have been able to catch <strong>The Pixies: Gouge</strong>, <strong>The
Clash: Westway to the World</strong> (of whom I like better as subjects
of documentaries moreso than as mucisians), <strong>Rasputin</strong>,
<strong>Haack: The King of Techno</strong>, and <strong>Bob
Marley</strong>… pretty good for the first month of service. Yuki and I
have finally finished watching the final episodes of the
<strong>Sopranos</strong> (season 5) and I personally was pleasantly
surprised by the twists in the final two episodes. That is to say, they
were twists to me, but I tend to never see movie twists during the
course of watching a film. I watched the pilot of <strong>Six Feet
Under</strong>… in a word… pretty good. I will continue to the next
episode soon.

On the films of cinema front, I did get around to finally watching
<strong>Audition</strong> (Odishon) by Takashi Miike. Overall it was
quite slow, but the acting was pretty good. There were a few truly
gut-wrentching scenes, but as a horror movie aficionado they were
perhaps a bit soft on me. That’s not to say that they should be viewed
by the squeamish however. I did watch a documentary called
<strong>American Movie</strong> about a small-town director named Mark
Borchardt trying to get his low-budget film <em>Coven</em> made. It was
about dreams and trials and smalltown living and the desperation to be
more than is expected of you and the lighter side of a dark soul and all
that crap, but really the best part was that Mark Borchardt reminds me
of this guy Psycho Drummer John (I don’t think that was his real name)
that I was in a band with just after high school. If I had just the
audio of this film on hand then I would have bet the mortgage that it
was a movie about PDJ. Creepy. Even without the nostalgic elements as a
factor, I would recommend watching it.

<p>That’s really all for me this month.<br /> -m</p>
