<strong>Ghost Hunters</strong><br /> Details the cases investigated by
<a href="http://www.the-atlantic-paranormal-society.com/">T.A.P.S</a>.
They tend to take a very scientific approach to investigating hauntings,
and because of that were often refuting the supernatural aspects of
their 1st season cases. However, perhaps due to a ratings grab, they
have been able to “catch” more ghostly occurances in the latest season.
Hopefully, this show will not turn into Most Haunted (see below).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Myth Busters</strong><br /> Probably the most entertaining show
that I watch. I like the pseudo-science aspect and the goofy antics of
the cast. However, I really watch to see if someone will one day shoot
their eye out. Call it NASCAR syndrome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Floyd</strong><br /> I’ve mentioned this guy before, but I
didn’t mention that he has multiple series on various topics from
African cooking, Italian, wine, etc… The one constant: increasing
drunkeness druing the course of a show.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lost</strong><br /> Technically, I do not watch Lost on TV.
Instead, I recently finished the 1st season DVD set and plan on doing
the same for season 2. Hopefully, I will be caught up by the time season
three comes around. I have intentionally avoided all conversation of
Lost season 2 for the very reason that I am obsessive about learning
details before I watch… anything.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pros vs. Joes</strong><br /> This is a stupid little show where
regular guys compete against retired and/or aged sports stars. It’s a
good show to turn your brain off for, and especially if you like to see
loudmouths trying to relive their glory days get pummeled.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Computer Science Lectures </strong><br /> I have no idea what
channel this is on nor what the real name of the show is, but there are
a bunch of C.S. lectures on various interesting topics. I guess it’s fun
if you’re into that kinf of stuff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Iron Chef</strong><br /> My staple. I haven’t been watching it
recently because I believe that I watched every single (American
released) episode. Plus, I absolutely to substitute IC:America for it.
</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Doctor Who</strong><br /></p>
The Eccleston version is pretty damned good. He might be my 4th favorite
doctor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>House</strong><br /> Season 1 was filled with uncredibly
annoying happy ending… season two has fixed that by making every episode
end in some bleak, no-body wins, manner.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Most Haunted</strong><br /> Probably the most ridiculous show on
television. A bunch of people go to (supposedly) haunted U.K. spots and
walk around looking scared and getting possessed. Derrick especially is
a hoot. He reminds me of a modern-day snake oil salesman.
</p>
<p>
<p>Shows I just don’t get:<br /> Desperate Housewives, Fear Factor, The
Colbert Report, Grey’s Anatomy, Unanimous, Deal or No Deal, E.R., NBA
Basketball</p>
