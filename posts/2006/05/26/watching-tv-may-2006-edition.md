<p><strong>Ghost Hunters</strong><br />
Details the cases investigated by <a href="http://www.the-atlantic-paranormal-society.com/">T.A.P.S</a>. They tend to take a very scientific approach to investigating hauntings, and because of that were often refuting the supernatural aspects of their 1st season cases. However, perhaps due to a ratings grab, they have been able to &#8220;catch&#8221; more ghostly occurances in the latest season. Hopefully, this show will not turn into Most Haunted (see below).</p>

<p><strong>Myth Busters</strong><br />
Probably the most entertaining show that I watch. I like the pseudo-science aspect and the goofy antics of the cast. However, I really watch to see if someone will one day shoot their eye out. Call it NASCAR syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>Floyd</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve mentioned this guy before, but I didn&#8217;t mention that he has multiple series on various topics from African cooking, Italian, wine, etc&#8230; The one constant: increasing drunkeness druing the course of a show.</p>
<p><strong>Lost</strong><br />
Technically, I do not watch Lost on TV. Instead, I recently finished the 1st season DVD set and plan on doing the same for season 2. Hopefully, I will be caught up by the time season three comes around. I have intentionally avoided all conversation of Lost season 2 for the very reason that I am obsessive about learning details before I watch&#8230; anything.</p>

<p><strong>Pros vs. Joes</strong><br />
This is a stupid little show where regular guys compete against retired and/or aged sports stars. It&#8217;s a good show to turn your brain off for, and especially if you like to see loudmouths trying to relive their glory days get pummeled.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Science Lectures </strong><br />
I have no idea what channel this is on nor what the real name of the show is, but there are a bunch of C.S. lectures on various interesting topics. I guess it&#8217;s fun if you&#8217;re into that kinf of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Chef</strong><br />
My staple. I haven&#8217;t been watching it recently because I believe that I watched every single (American released) episode. Plus, I absolutely to substitute IC:America for it.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Who</strong><br />

The Eccleston version is pretty damned good.  He might be my 4th favorite doctor.</p>
<p><strong>House</strong><br />
Season 1 was filled with uncredibly annoying happy ending&#8230; season two has fixed that by making every episode end in some bleak, no-body wins, manner.</p>
<p><strong>Most Haunted</strong><br />
Probably the most ridiculous show on television. A bunch of people go to (supposedly) haunted U.K. spots and walk around looking scared and getting possessed. Derrick especially is a hoot. He reminds me of a modern-day snake oil salesman.</p>
<p>Shows I just don&#8217;t get:<br />
Desperate Housewives, Fear Factor, The Colbert Report, Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, Unanimous, Deal or No Deal, E.R., NBA Basketball
