<p>There’s a whole class of books on technology that are histories of
some system or software or some-such that are not at all technical.
However, in every case below I found myself highly motivated to write
code and/or create a software system after (often during) reading these
books. I hereby present my favorite inspirational technical books that
are not technical, with no particular order implied.</p>
<h4 id="the-soul-of-a-new-machine-by-tracy-kidder"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine-Tracy-Kidder/dp/0316491977/?tag=fogus-20">The
Soul of a New Machine</a></em> by Tracy Kidder</h4>
<p>This was the first of this type of book that I read. An undergraduate
CS professor recommended this and the next and I read them both over
winter break. This is probably my all-time favorite book of this type.
It was highly inspirational to me during college.</p>
<h4
id="the-cuckoos-egg-tracking-a-spy-through-the-maze-of-computer-espionage-by-cliff-stoll"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Cuckoos-Egg-Tracking-Computer-Espionage/dp/1416507787/tag=fogus-20">The
Cuckoo’s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer
Espionage</a></em> by Cliff Stoll</h4>
<p>This book was also recommended by my professor and I found it
riveting.</p>
<h4
id="bootstrapping-douglas-engelbart-coevolution-and-the-origins-of-personal-computing-by-thierry-bardini"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Bootstrapping-Engelbart-Coevolution-Personal-Computing/dp/0804738718/?tag=fogus-20">Bootstrapping:
Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal
Computing</a></em> by Thierry Bardini</h4>
<p>Sadly Engelbart is rarely remembered and when he is it’s for the
wrong reason. He was a visionary amongst visionaries of his time and
most of his more radical ideas are still relevant and hardly realized
even today.</p>
<h4
id="one-jump-ahead-challenging-human-supremacy-in-checkers-by-jonathan-schaeffer"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Jump-Ahead-Challenging-Supremacy/dp/B00YDK9Y00/?tag=fogus-20">One
Jump Ahead: Challenging Human Supremacy in Checkers</a></em> by Jonathan
Schaeffer</h4>
<p>A difficult book to find, but worth every penny.</p>
<h4
id="masters-of-doom-how-two-guys-created-an-empire-and-transformed-pop-culture-by-david-kushner"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155/?tag=fogus-20">Masters
of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop
Culture</a></em> by David Kushner</h4>
<p>John Carmack’s story is astonishing and this book was the first that
really made me stop reading numerous times because I was motivated to
create code immediately.</p>
<h4 id="steve-jobs-and-the-next-big-thing-by-randall-stross"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Next-Big-Thing/dp/0689121350/?tag=fogus-20">Steve
Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing</a></em> by Randall Stross</h4>
<p>While the book is often claimed to be biased, I liked it much better
than any of the other Apple folklore books. How NeXT was funded,
created, and run was a distillation of the pre-2nd-coming Steve Jobs –
ego-driven to the max.</p>
<h4
id="revolution-in-the-valley-the-insanely-great-story-of-how-the-mac-was-made-by-andy-hertzfeld"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Valley-Insanely-Great-Story/dp/1449316247/?tag=fogus-20">Revolution
in the Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made</a></em>
by Andy Hertzfeld</h4>
<p>This one is probably my second favorite in that class of books. There
are too many to count and most tell the same stories from slightly
different perspectives.</p>
<h4 id="iwoz-by-steve-woziak"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/iWoz-Computer-Invented-Personal-Co-Founded/dp/0393330435/?tag=fogus-20">iWoz</a></em>
by Steve Woziak</h4>
<p>A book about a fun dude doing what he loved and changing the world.
Very inspirational.</p>
<h4
id="engines-of-creation-the-coming-era-of-nanotechnology-by-eric-drexler"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Engines-Creation-Nanotechnology-Library-Science/dp/0385199732/?tag=fogus-20">Engines
of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology</a></em> by Eric
Drexler</h4>
<p>This skirts the line between inspirational book and manifesto, but
it’s too good to keep off this list.</p>
<h4 id="who-owns-the-future-by-jaron-lanier"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Future-Jaron-Lanier/dp/1451654979/?tag=fogus-20">Who
Owns the Future?</a></em> by Jaron Lanier</h4>
<p>Ditto. Also, very relevant to today’s tech climate.</p>
<h4
id="dreaming-in-code-two-dozen-programmers-three-years-4732-bugs-and-one-quest-for-transcendent-software-by-scott-rosenberg"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Dreaming-Code-Programmers-Transcendent-Software/dp/1400082471/?tag=fogus-20">Dreaming
in Code: Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years, 4,732 Bugs, and One Quest
for Transcendent Software</a></em> by Scott Rosenberg</h4>
<p>Am amazing story about a system that may have been too big for its
software team to create, or maybe about one that was too far ahead of
its time. I’ve been on both types of projects and this book hit very
close to home from both angles.</p>
<h4
id="the-dream-machine-j.c.r.-licklider-and-the-revolution-that-made-computing-personal-by-m.-mitchell-waldrop"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-Licklider-Revolution-Computing/dp/0670899763/?tag=fogus-20">The
Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing
Personal</a></em> by M. Mitchell Waldrop</h4>
<p>A panoply of the biggest names in computing working to augment the
human mind. It never happened of course.</p>
<h4
id="dealers-of-lightning-xerox-parc-and-the-dawn-of-the-computer-age-by-michael-hiltzik"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer/dp/0887309895/?tag=fogus-20">Dealers
of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age</a></em> by
Michael Hiltzik</h4>
<p>The climate of Xerox Parc in its heyday must have been an amazing
place to be.</p>
<h4 id="hackers-and-painters-by-paul-graham"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Painters-Big-Ideas-Computer/dp/1449389554/?tag=fogus-20">Hackers
and Painters</a></em> by Paul Graham</h4>
<p>I miss circa 2002 Paul Graham.</p>
<h4 id="points-of-view-a-tribute-to-alan-kay"><a
href="http://vpri.org/pov/">Points of View: A Tribute to Alan
Kay</a></h4>
<p>Various essays on Alan Kay, available for free. Some are great
reads.</p>
<h4
id="fire-in-the-valley-the-birth-and-death-of-the-personal-computer-by-paul-freiberger-and-michael-swaine"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Valley-Birth-Personal-Computer/dp/1937785769/?tag=fogus-20">Fire
in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer</a></em> by
Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine</h4>
<p>The stories about companies other than Microsoft and Apple are my
favorite, especially those containing Lee Felsenstein.</p>
<h4
id="crypto-how-the-code-rebels-beat-the-government-saving-privacy-in-the-digital-age-by-steven-levy"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Crypto-Rebels-Government-Privacy-Digital/dp/0140244328/?tag=fogus-20">Crypto:
How the Code Rebels Beat the Government Saving Privacy in the Digital
Age</a></em> by Steven Levy</h4>
<p>A book about smart people thinking hard about hard problems.</p>
<h4 id="the-brain-makers-by-hp-newquist"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Makers-HP-Newquist/dp/0672304120/?tag=fogus-20">The
Brain Makers</a></em> by HP Newquist</h4>
<p>A good book, but somewhat stilted. I found it inspirational mostly to
learn more about the history of AI and its key players.</p>
<h4 id="history-of-programming-languages-volume-1-and-volume-2"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Programming-Languages-Monograph-Series/dp/0127450408/?tag=fogus-20">History
of Programming Languages, Volume 1</a> and <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Programming-Languages-Thomas-Bergin/dp/0201895021/?tag=fogus-20">Volume
2</a></em></h4>
<p>This is kinda my thing… probably more technical than the others, but
this is my list and I’ll bend the rules as needed.</p>
<h4 id="the-new-media-reader"><em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Media-Reader-Noah-Wardrip-Fruin/dp/0262232278/?tag=fogus-20">The
New Media Reader</a></em></h4>
<p>Basically a distillation of <em>Elgelbart -&gt; Alan Kay -&gt; Bret
Victor</em> thinking. Reading this will make you wonder what on earth
happened to the promise of the computing industry – and hopefully do
something to try and fix it.</p>
<p>What are your favorites? Recommendations always welcomed.</p>
