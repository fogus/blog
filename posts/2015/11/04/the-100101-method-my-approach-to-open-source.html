<p></a>For many years I was whole hog into the open-source movement and
at the time I rarely wrote a stitch of code in my free time that didn’t
find itself in a public Sourceforge/GCode/Github repo.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
However, over time I came to learn that the burden that came with
publicly offering code to the universe, to put it mildly, sucked. Aside
from the fact that much of the code that was “released” was sub-par, the
very act of putting code out into the world implied (whether <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorial_intent">intentionally</a>,
or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader-response_criticism">not</a>)
a willingness to participate in a social contract<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
with those who chose to use it for their own purposes. Granted I’m not
necessarily against that social contract per se, instead my eventual
change of heart around releasing code became such that I was more
reserved in my approach. The approach that I now use for releasing code
into the wild is governed by an approach called the “100:10:1 method,” a
term coined by Nick Bentley.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="what-even-is-the-100101-method">What even is the 100:10:1
method?</h2>
<p>I won’t belabor the details of the method, you can read more about it
<a
href="https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/the-100-10-1-method-for-game-design/">from
the perspective of a talented game designer</a>, but I’ll try to frame
it in the context of my approach to open source software
development.</p>
<p>The 100:10:1 method has three parts, each described below.</p>
<h3 id="write-down-100-wacky-ideas">Write down 100 wacky ideas</h3>
<p>The first step was to find a notebook and a pen and just write down
100 ideas for interesting open source projects. These project ideas
ranged across all manner of topics, depth, and quality. I thought of
wild language ideas, new features in existing projects, system designs,
protocols, missing documentation, interesting forks, golfing code,
games, prototypes, implementations of paper ideas, second-systems,
whatever.</p>

</figure>
<p>Prior to incorporating the 100:10:1 method, I had always had a
notebook filled with wacky ideas, but they tended to be hither and
thither and never in one place. Laying 100 ideas out on a few pages let
me really focus my attention on them all at once, allowing me to weigh
them against each other for the purposes of the second step.</p>
<h3 id="make-a-mvp-for-10-of-those-ideas">Make a MVP for 10 of those
ideas</h3>
<p>Having 100 ideas laid out in front of me let me really get a grasp on
the ideas that I not only felt interested in pursuing at that time, but
also those that I felt could benefit not only myself, but others as
well.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Of the original 100 I picked 10
projects that I was certain I wanted to dive into and explore. For lack
of a better term I picked the 10 projects that I wanted to write a
minimum viable “product” for all – <em>concurrently</em>.</p>

<p>Now you might be thinking that 10 concurrent projects is in itself a
burden. This would not be an incorrect assessment. However, I realized
that minimum viable implementations for most of the projects that I
chose would probably never see the light of day and if they did it would
be months to years before that time. You see, at one time I had viewed
releasing open source software as a method for putting a potentially
useful tool into the hands of others. Sadly, over time that view had
degenerated into the idea that releasing code into the wild was in
itself good – the method had supplanted the original goal. My view now
is that it’s highly likely that the code that I’m working on in my spare
time is only an exploration that may or may not bear fruit – and that’s
OK.</p>
<p>A nice benefit of working on 10 concurrent projects is that when I
feel that one has stagnated I can simply move on to another that
motivates me more. As a person with a rich hobby, community, and family
life outside of mere coding, it benefits me immensely to use the power
of a bevy of choice to battle fleeting interest. Having 10 concurrent
projects means that there’s always one that can grab my immediate
interest. I’ve learned (the hard way) that when my full interest is
directed on a task I’m much more efficient in my production. Eventually
however, one of these projects will bear fruit<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and
when that happens I’m ready for the final stage.</p>
<h3
id="fully-develop-one-of-those-ideas-into-a-legitimate-software-release">Fully
develop one of those ideas into a legitimate software release</h3>
<p>At some point during the 10-stage, one of the projects will
inevitably turn into something valuable.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
When that happens I then take that one project and really work to turn
it into a quality software artifact.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> This means to go all the
way and ensure a robust system with solid examples, tests,
documentation, stable API, blog posts and/or talks, and even a
web-presence perhaps.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Up until this point the code for said project was for my own purposes
and would likely need a lot of work to make it into something that I’d
be proud to share with others. It depends on the complexity of the
software of course, but it’s likely that the final stage takes the
longest amount of time to realize. Likewise, it’s at this final stage
that I’m most likely to scrap a project entirely. I’ve found (again, the
hard way) that if I can’t bring myself to turn a codebase into something
that I’m willing to write documentation, examples, and tests for then
there’s zero chance that I’ll be willing to maintain it for the next X
years.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’ve used this method for some time now, and prior to that I followed
something similar and have found good results so far. That is, both <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E2CoObAaPQ">Zeder and
Patagonia</a> were developed using the 100:10:1 method, or some
facsimile of it and I have a Clojure library named “Tathata” that’s in
the final stages right now. Perhaps one of my 10 current projects<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> will bear similar fruit, but if not
that’s OK, I’ll just pick 10 more.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>As it turns out, my other hobbies (game design,
Sabremetrics, writing, etc.) followed a similar trend in the past, but
like open source coding they too have fallen into the 100:10:1 ideal.<a
href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>And unfortunately there seems to be a tendency to view
open sourcing as a moral statement as well.<a href="#fnref2"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The name “100:10:1 method” comes from <a
href="https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/the-100-10-1-method-for-game-design/">a
post by Nick Bentley describing his game design approach</a>. While my
own views on open source coding had already become somewhat similar to
Nick’s, it was his post that gave me a name and base structure to my ad
hoc approach. Thank you Mr. Bentley, wherever you are!<a href="#fnref3"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Because if we’re not creating open sourced code to
benefit others, what’s the point.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>And sometimes a project will rot on the vine. In this
case I have no qualms about trashing it and promoting another from the
list of 100. Indeed, the list of 100 is a living list and things drop
off and come on all the time.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Or not… what me worry?<a href="#fnref6"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>When that one project surfaces, I still work on the
other 9 concurrently, just at the more superficial, MVP-esque level. If
the fancy strikes me I might even pick another from the list of 100 to
elevate… there are no hard and fast rules about this method of course.<a

<li id="fn8"><p>And of course a finalized name and logo. :p<a
href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>As you can see, I apply the 100:10:1 method to other
creative hobbies as well. From coding to music to writing to game
design, it works for any number of creative activities.<a href="#fnref9"
