<p>Lately I’ve been obsessed with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome">palindromes</a>. I have
no idea why, but I find the topic fascinating. Besides reading papers
and books<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> on the subject, I’ve been exploring
writing some utilities for detecting<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and generating
palindromes in Clojure sequences.</p>
<p>Before I talk about a couple of (IMO) cool Clojure functions, let me
take a moment to define palindromic sequences. Simply put, a palindromic
sequence is one that “reads” the same forwards and backwards, or in code
has the following property:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
(= a-sequence (reverse a-sequence))
;;=> true
</pre>
<p>A concrete example of a palindromic sequence is the vector
<code>[:a :b :b :a]</code>.</p>
<p>What led me to writing the functions below is that I’ve been toying
around with a few game designs in my head that center around
palindromes. Specifically, I’m writing an AI that can play these designs
and flesh out some of the sticking points.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
However, to make the AI somewhat smart it has to be able to look at a
group of things and determine all of the possible palindromes that can
be built from it.</p>
<h2 id="detecting">Detecting</h2>
<p>The first matter to deal with for my AI was to create a function
that, given a sequence, returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>
depending on whether it’s palindromic. I started out writing a
convoluted <code>palindrome?</code> function that walked both ends of a
sequence and compared the elements in place, but it wasn’t terribly
efficient nor legible. Instead, I decided to just write the function
almost exactly as I described it above:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
(defn palindrome? [s]
  (= (seq s) (reverse s)))

(palindrome? [1 2 3 2 1])
;;=> true

(palindrome? [1 2 3 1 2])
;; false

(palindrome? "abba")
;;=> true
</pre>
<p>This turns out to be fairly fast, at least for my purposes, and it
was definitely faster than my original. A nice property about this
implementation is that it’ll detect palindromic strings<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
also. This was a nice discovery, but the real fun came next.</p>
<h2 id="finding-palindromes">Finding palindromes</h2>
<p>Given a Clojure vector of <code>[:a :b :b]</code> there are two
possible palindromes that can be made from it: <code>[:b :b]</code> and
<code>[:b :a :b]</code>. The way to find this answer is to perform the
following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find all of the different ways to group the elements of the
original</li>
<li>Calculate all of the different ways to arrange all of the
groupings</li>
<li>Keep only the palindromes</li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully, for me there is a Clojure contrib library called <a
href="https://github.com/clojure/math.combinatorics/">math.combinatorics</a>
that has two functions, <code>partitions</code> and
<code>permutations</code>, that could take care of #1 and #2.
Unfortunately for me, math.combinatorics only handles sequences of
numbers, so I had to use modified versions<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> of
the functions <code>parts</code> and <code>perms</code> instead.</p>
<p>First, to find all of the groupings of the original I just need to
calculate the possible partitions:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
(->> (comb/parts [:a :b :b])) ;; calc groupings

;;=> (([:a :b :b]) 
;;    ([:a :b] [:b]) 
;;    ([:a] [:b :b]) 
;;    ([:a] [:b] [:b]))
</pre>
<p>You’ll notice that this doesn’t create separate groups for the groups
of <code>:a</code> and the first <code>:b</code> and another for the
second <code>:b</code>. This is because the groups created are
considered equivalent and not replicated. However, using a different
input set shows a different behavior:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
(->> (comb/parts [:a :b :c])) ;; calc groupings

;;=> (([:a :b :c]) 
;;    ([:a :b] [:c]) 
;;    ([:a :c] [:b]) 
;;    ([:a] [:b :c]) 
;;    ([:a] [:b] [:c]))
</pre>
<p>So you see, <code>[:a :b]</code> and <code>[:a :c]</code> are both
generated. Without going too far afield, using my modified functions
allows me to manipulate the way that groups are formed by overriding the
<code>Comparable#compareTo</code> method, but that’s a different
discussion.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Now that I’ve calculated the groupings, I can gather them up and get
rid of all of the duplicates and singleton groups (which are
uninteresting palindromes indeed):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
(->> (comb/parts [:a :b :b])   ;; calc groupings
     (apply concat)            ;; gather them up
     (filter #(> (count %) 1)) ;; remove singletons
     set)                      ;; remove dups

;;=> #{[:a :b] [:b :b] [:a :b :b]}
</pre>
<p>There are more efficient ways to get this result, but this is good
enough for my purposes.</p>
<p>Now that I have the unique groupings I want to use <code>perms</code>
to generate all of the possible arrangements of the groupings:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
(->> (comb/parts [:a :b :b])   ;; calc groupings
     (apply concat)            ;; gather them up
     (filter #(> (count %) 1)) ;; remove singletons
     set                       ;; remove dups
     (map comb/perms))         ;; calc arrangements

;;=> (([:a :b] [:b :a]) 
;;    ([:b :b]) 
;;    ([:a :b :b] [:b :a :b] [:b :b :a]))
</pre>
<p>So once again, I then want to gather the arrangements up and keep
only the palindromes:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">
(->> (comb/parts [:a :b :b])   ;; calc groupings
     (apply concat)            ;; gather them up
     (filter #(> (count %) 1)) ;; remove singletons
     set                       ;; remove dups
     (map comb/perms)          ;; calc arrangements
     (apply concat)            ;; gather them up
     (filter palindrome?))     ;; keep palindromes

;;=> ([:b :b] [:b :a :b])
</pre>
<p>And that’s it – all of the possible palindromes for
<code>[:a :b :b]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>Even though there is a larger context to all of this, I wanted to
share a few of the bits that I thought were interesting. There’s more to
palindromic functions than what’s shown in this post, including a
function to take a sequence and calculate the most “profitable”
arrangement. For the purposes of the function, “profit” is defined as
the total number of elements forming a palindrome (including
sub-palindromes) in a sequence. For example, for the sequence
<code>[:a :a :b :b]</code> the most profitable arrangement is
<code>[:a :b :b :a]</code> worth 6 points (<code>[:a :b :b :a]</code>
plus <code>[:b :b]</code>). That was fun to figure out, but I leave the
implementation as an exercise to the reader.</p>
