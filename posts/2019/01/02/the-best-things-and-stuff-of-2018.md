Great things and people that I discovered, learned, read, met, etc. in 2018.  No particular ordering is implied.  Not everything is new.

## Great blog-posts / articles read

* *[One Windows Kernel](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Kernel-Internals/One-Windows-Kernel/ba-p/267142)* - *While I’m also a sucker for all things osdev[^osdev], my practical interests have abated in recent years. That said, I love a good kernel design article and this one does not fail to satisfy.*
* *[Notes from the Intelpocalypse](https://lwn.net/Articles/742702/)* - *I hesitate to admit that I wasn’t terribly impressed enough by the Intel CPU security hole news earlier in the year to dive deeply into the details. Maybe I’m just jaded. That said this article does a great job of highlighting why the hole is such a big deal.*
* *[Jenn Schiffer’s electronic email](https://jennmoney.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f74a824f6424f5f5819ec0f77&amp;id=738ef47ea4)* - *I'm constantly impressed by Jenn's sense of humor and cutting satire around the programming and tech "communities" and their denizens.*
* *[A Look at the Design of Lua](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/11/232214-a-look-at-the-design-of-lua/fulltext)* - *I’m truly a sucker when it comes to all things langdev and this article hits all of my favorite touch points, is well written, and is about a language that I jealously admire.*
* *[Origins of the Finger Command](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.folklore.computers/IdFAN6HPw3k/Ci5BfN8i26AJ)* - *At one time Usenet was the place where people posted technical articles and there are literally thousands of posts archived just like this one. Maybe 2019 can be the year where I take a month and harvest old Usenet posts and reform them in modern contexts. In any case, while this article is light on the deep tech, it's a fun anecdote about a little bit of esoterica.*
* *[Mr. Rogers Was My Actual Neighbor](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/7/26/17616380/fred-rogers-documentary-2018-mister-rogers-neighborhood)* - *I’m of the age that I can vividly remember watching Mr. Rogers[^cheas] on television. Though I don’t recall an active interest in learning about the man behind the character, it was fascinating to learn via this article that the public and private personas may not have been too far apart.*
* *[The Secret Call to Andy Grove...](https://www.cake.co/conversations/g4CP6zJ/the-secret-call-to-andy-grove-that-may-have-helped-apple-buy-next)* - *It was a good year for articles covering my guilty pleasures and this one covering a little known anecdote around Apple lore was fun to read. I had a difficult time following the flow of the post, but found the journey satisfying -- especially if you're into the lore.*
* *[In Search of the Last Great Video Store](https://blog.blcklst.com/in-search-of-the-last-great-video-store-efcc393f2982)* - *I'm old enough to have spent hours perusing the shelves of local video stores. As a kid I would scour the shelves of the horror sections[^maus] to find something... anything that I hadn't already rented and devoured. For a certain generation of folks this post is a nice bit of nostalgia.*
* *[What Can Sports Tell Us About the Quality of Decision Making?](http://danluu.com/bad-decisions/)* - *I have played baseball all of my life[^2b] and so would consider myself a fan of the game. Indeed, as a kid growing up in Baltimore I would, more often than not, agonize over the fate of the home team Orioles. Year after year I would try to understand the seemingly nonsensical decisions that the local team made. This perplexity eventually led me to explore [Sabermetrics](https://sabr.org/sabermetrics) in an attempt to find some deeper meaning. While the numbers at times pointed at hidden player value, in more cases than not they pointed at something else perhaps... maybe... just maybe... the managerial and personnel decisions were often made for reasons that had little to do with baseball at all.*
* *[Anthony Burgess’s Boundless Curiosity](https://www.newstatesman.com/The-Ink-Trade-Selected-Journalism-1961-1993-Anthony-Burgess-review)* - *Burgess is an infinitely interesting intellect who lived a satisfyingly Renaissance-esque life. This article is a celebration of lifetime learning framed by Burgess and his habits.*
* *[A Brand New Interview with DFW](https://electricliterature.com/a-brand-new-interview-with-david-foster-wallace-71c03223294b)* - *I’ve read most of what David Foster Wallace had to say so it was nice to come across a “new” interview even if much have what was said was said in other interviews and essays.*
* *[Personal notes on Corman Lisp 3.1](https://chaoticlab.io/lisp/update/2018/12/30/corman-3-1-release.html)* - *The last post that I read in 2018 and a good one to boot. The author nicely highlights the high points of open source contribution and reminds us that when it works it's a joy to participate in.*

[^osdev]: I have an irregularly updated list of [OSDEV resources](http://fogus.me/thunks/osdev.html) online that I need to get back to one day.

[^cheas]: Growing up in the Baltimore area I vividly remember Captain Chesapeake... anyone else remember that dude?

[^maus]: One that I remember seeing often but never watching was *Mausoleum*. I finally saw it in 2018 and wow was it terrible.

[^2b]: I played second-base my entire teenage years but have shifted to shortstop in my older years.

## Most viewed blog posts by me

I’ve been trying something new this year. Mostly I’ve been posting random thoughts and bits of data coupled with a pointer to an album[^music] that I enjoy rather than working on long-form essays and such. All of that said, there were a few high-traffic posts on my blog.

* *[Soup](http://blog.fogus.me/2018/10/25/soup/)* - *This is a sparsely annotated collection of of Alan Kay posts on Hacker News talking about object oriented programming, messaging, and general Alan Kay-esque topics.*
* *[Starboy](http://blog.fogus.me/2018/11/27/starboy/)* - *Some notes about how I tend to read and study codebases.*

[^music]: I think I'll mix it up in 2019 and focus my posts on books that get me thinking instead.

## Favorite technical books discovered (and read)

I’ve intentionally reduced the number of technical books that I consume, but there are a few that I “found” in 2018 that are stellar.

* *[The Rust Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Steve-Klabnik/dp/1593278284?tag=fogus-20)* by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nicols - *A very good book by a couple of very good authors about an exciting programming language that’s relatively new. As an one time deep C programmer I have come to appreciate the space that Rust may fill for me in my programming explorations.*
* *[Essential LISP](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Lisp-John-R-Anderson/dp/0201111489?tag=fogus-20)* by John Anderson - *At this point in my life it’s difficult to find a Lisp book that I’ve not only never read but also find interesting. While not the most comprehensive reference on any given implementation, the language covered is an in between Lisp that existed around 1986 or so which is pretty cool from a historical perspective.*

## Favorite non-technical books read

* *[The Death of Ivan Ilych](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Ivan-Ilyich-Bantam-Classics/dp/0553210351?tag=fogus-20)* by Leo Tolstoy - *An oddly compelling tale about a man who barely made a mark on the world and how his death was perceived by those near to him.*
