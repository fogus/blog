<p>In the pantheon of my personal favorite books on computing, <em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Programming-Environments-David-Barstow/dp/0070038856/?tag=fogus-20">Interactive
Programming Environments</a></em> by Barstow[^bar], Shrobe, and
Sandewall places somewhere in the proverbial chancel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Programming-Environments-David-Barstow/dp/0070038856/?tag=fogus-20"><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IPE-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6549" /></a></p>
<p>The book covers a wide range of topics from Lisp Machines, Smalltalk,
Pascal, OOP, UNIX, AI, and intelligent agents but the common thread is
this:</p>
<p><em>Your programming environments should be an active partner in the
act of creating systems.</em></p>
<p>This post contains notes on some of the points along this vector with
some jumping-off points for further exploration and research.</p>
<h2 id="moore-and-forth">Moore and Forth</h2>
<p><em>Programming a Problem-Oriented Language</em> by Charles Moore (<a
href="http://www.forth.org/POL.pdf">PDF</a>) is Chuck Moore’s thesis on
Forth and its design and core philosophy. The genesis of the language
stems from a simple premise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve written many programs over the years. I’ve tried to write good
programs, and I’ve observed the manner in which I write them rather
critically. My goal has been to decrease the effort required and
increase the quality produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moore’s motivations culminated in the Forth programming language,
which in turn led to the term “problem-oriented-language.” The basic
idea is that a programming language should facilitate the construction
of programs by allowing you to build in layers, where each layer is a
specialized language for building the layer above it. Certainly the book
dives deeper into matters such as simplicity, YAGNI, bootstrapping, and
the like, but the core idea of <em>problem-orientation</em> is the key
take away.</p>
<h2 id="fundament">Fundament</h2>
<p>Moore’s work encourages the creation of the entire programming stack,
but there are varying levels at which an interactive environment can
evolve up from. For example, one of my attempts at the IPE idea built on
the Java Virtual Machine and its included graphical interface APIs. The
idea was to build a tool that I could explore Java APIs with in an
interactive manner. However, to do that I had to build a total
environment for building scratchpads for exploration.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-1.38.02-PM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-6564" /></p>
<p>I got it into a good place eventually, but the increased capabilities
of the <a href="https://www.bluej.org">BlueJ</a> environment convinced
me to end development. Later I worked on various IPEs hosted on
platforms varying from <a href="http://www.clipsrules.net">CLIPS</a>, to
<a href="https://github.com/alepharchives/ordoemacs">Emacs</a>, to <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420043846/http://le-trombone.livejournal.com/182656.html">Emacs
in CLIPS</a>, to JavaScript. I learned a lot along the way, but never
felt that I had even scratched the surface of finding an environment
that helped me to explore.</p>
<h2 id="work-for-the-next-10-years">Work for the next 10 years</h2>
<p>Any work in IPEs is likely to require a huge amount of effort and
brain-power to crack. Indeed, you could expect to spend the next
10-years just gaining a deep understanding of the problem space and
contributing to the rich landscape. Even after the 10-years are spent
the expected likelihood is that any artifacts created along the way are
likely to find little to no usage or to be obviated by something else
entirely. Enormous amounts of effort went into systems such as <a

every one of them are relegated to the dustbin of computing history.
It’s difficult to start a project that most likely will merely provide
footnotes to the next generation of proposed solutions.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-80-Interactive-Programming-Environment-Addison-Wesley/dp/0201113724/?tag=fogus-20">Smalltalk</a>
is a great example of a system that evolved via bootstrapping new
iterations using previous versions of itself. Alan Kay talks about this
as the ideal for Smalltalk development for much of its early life in his
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY&amp;t=3490s">famous
OOPSLA 1997 talk</a>. The whole talk is an amazing repository of wisdom
that hasn’t yet been truly tapped for inspiration.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TheBlueBook-227x300.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6570" /></p>
<p>That said, while Smalltalk itself moved away from the meta-language
bootstrapping model with the development of Smalltalk-80, the early
principles are foundational. The seminal book <em><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-80-Language-Implementation-Adele-Goldberg/dp/0201113716/?tag=fogus-20">Smalltalk-80:
The Language and Its Implementation</a></em> captures the gestalt of the
early days by including the source code for a <a
href="http://www.mirandabanda.org/bluebook/">VM for the language
described in the book using the language described in the book</a>. The
ideal outlined by early Smalltalk implementations (and <a
href="https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak">Squeak</a>) is an ideal that IPEs
should strive for. That is, the purpose of an Interactive Programming
Environment should not be to provide a solution, but instead to provide
a set of ideas useful for exploring higher-level ideas better than those
provided in the base environment.</p>
<h2 id="emacs">Emacs</h2>
<p>These days the closest thing that I have to a powerful IPE in my life
is the Emacs text editor. In addition to my place for writing blog
posts, Emacs is also my programming environment, idea scratchpad,
TODO-list manager, a source control interface, and occasionally a <a
href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/fun-games-in-emacs">game
system</a>. Emacs is extended with the Emacs Lisp programming language
and provides a set of abstractions around working with text buffers. The
act of extending Emacs is a bit of black magic, but at least <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-GNU-Emacs-Extensions-Customizations-ebook/dp/B0043M56SW?tag=fogus-20">one
interesting manual for writing extensions</a> has been written.</p>
<h2 id="a-total-head-space">A total head-space</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/155/87/">Douglas
Englebart’s NLS</a> was a total collaborative environment meant to
enable its users to engage in “knowledge work.” The idea was to provide
a repository for knowledge, tools for collaboration, idea capture, and
discovery. However, NLS was not just a set of software tools, instead it
was an environment that ensconced the knowledge worker.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.fogus.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/enviboard-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6574" /></p>
<p>From the now ubiquitous mouse to the chorded keyboard, the NLS
workspace was designed as a phase-1 stage in moving towards
human-machine co-evolution. Perhaps the ideal for IPEs is not just a
software concern but instead a total headspace. There was a popular
trend in software writing tools that promised immersive environments
(see <a
href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">Writeroom</a>
and <a href="https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter</a> for
examples), but they stopped at the screen. Perhaps something akin to <a
