So with a month and a half to go I wonder if I can make it to the magical 100 books in a year?  Certainly I could if I limit myself to [Algis Budrys][ab] and [PG Wodehouse][pg] (which in reality would not be a bad thing).  I may or may not cheat to get there, I'll reassess in the beginning of December.  The real sore point is that I have recently wasted 937 + 110 + 150 pages on *Anathem*, *The City at the End of Time*, and *The Black Company* respectively.  I would like to have that time back please.

Things that I wish I had done instead of reading (or attempting to read anyway) those three novels:

read Star Wars fan-fic, watch American Idol, root canal surgery, read #ruby transcripts, listen to my Mac's robotic voices recite codinghorror.com, read John McCain's biography, read Cindy McCain's biography, marvel at the wonders of Yuri Geller, play E.T. on the Atari 2600, read high-school angst poetry, listen to the Peter Gabriel, watch Thomas the Tank Engine, watch Dora the Explorer, eat tripe soup, [use Windows Vista](http://blog.fogus.me/2007/04/02/four-hours-with-vista/), watch endless loops of Maury Povich, and stab my eyes with pencil graphite.
