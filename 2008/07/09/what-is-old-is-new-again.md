So I decided to change the site back to primarily a Wordpress affair.  My grand <a href="http://webgen.rubyforge.org/">webgen</a> experiment was not necessarily a failure, but the hoops one had to jump through to maintain an entire site were of the flaming sort.  That is not to say that webgen is dead on this site, in fact I will use it for what it is good for... special purpose pages such as my <a href="/static/">essays</a> and <a href="/projects/">project details</a>.  All of the other little daily updates will be done via WP.  

Likewise, the theme has changed from the Lachrymology plus Cornflower blues to a more minimal venture directly ripped from the inspiring <a href="http://tomayko.com/">Ryan Tomayko</a>... sorry sir, but I could never do better on my own.... standing on the shoulders of frost giants and all that crap.
