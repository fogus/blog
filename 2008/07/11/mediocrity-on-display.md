So my neighborhood is having a <em>best yard</em> contest.  The funny thing is that our community is under strict HOA guidelines concerning just what we are allowed to do with our property.  Walking around our neighborhood one begins to sense very quickly the absolute and stifling sameness of the whole affair.  Granted a few people have done some clever arrangements within the guidelines of the HOA "recommendations" (enforced by fine), but regardless remain thoroughly uninspiring.  It truly is nonsense like this that makes me long for the days of living in Adam's Morgan, DC where one could enjoy an explosion of sensory stimulation during even the most cursory of strolls.  

HOA-run <em>best yard</em> contest?  FAIL.
