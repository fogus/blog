Confession
-------------
I have tried to write my own text editor.  I succeeded, yet failed.  

### Lame
I mean really... who the hell, in this modern day and age, writes their own text editor?[^1]
  Additionally, when said text editor is written, who the hell writes one with separate [interaction modes][viway]?  Long story short: my editor was a lame clone of the EDT editor[^2] in vogue... well, never.  

#### Why?
I would like to take this moment to write off my sinful ways to youthful numbskullery.  That is, there was a time when I thought that I <a href="http://twitter.com/fogus/statuses/835954463">shat programmatic gold</a> and anything written by hacker A could be improved upon by myself.  Why the hell should I use Pico?  I could do better than that!  Nano?  Gafaw!  Emacs?  Eight Megabytes and Constantly Swapping!  LOL!  What a human buttwipe I [was][am].  

The Results
--------------
I suppose it was a nice learning process to write my own editor and all of that noise[^3], but fruit of my labor has left me wanting... yearning[^4].  That is, not only do I have a pile of C code that even Notepad scoffs at, but I have not taken it on myself to actually learn an editor that [would][j] [happily][vim] <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">urinate</a> all <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">over</a> my sad effort.  My life would have been better served had I ignored my inner dickweed and simply learned what the heck a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard">Meta-key</a> [was][am].  

#### My continual lameousity
I have since learned my lesson, scraped my horrible source code[^5], and attempted to pick up Emacs.  There is one giant problem however; I am so corrupt with the ways of a thousand editors, that Emacs confuses the piss out of me.  I get along alright I guess, but I *have* experienced that awe that most Emacs n00bs feel whenever they sit down with a true master.  That is, my boss and I sat down recently to hack through some source and I was astonished to see the way in which he utterly tore through Emacs with the intensity of a 1000 ninjas on fire -- I mean the guy has bucky bits coursing through his veins.  I felt like crying.[^6]   Think of it this way: he was fluently speaking Emacs, while I only know how to say "where is the toilet" and "I are American".  Perhaps this proficiency comes in time, but damn!  

Where to go from here
--------------------------
They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.  I'm actually not that old, but I am certainly mangy.  Perhaps there is hope for me yet.  However, I have to be much more systematic about my Emacs education:

#### Live in Emacs
There is a slight problem here.  That is, I do 98% of my work on OSX boxen and my Emacs of choice is the lickable [Aquamacs][aqm].  The problem here is that it is too easy to fall into the old mousey habits[^7] this way.  Therefore, it might serve to use the command line Emacs instead, or perhaps burn myself with cigarettes every time I hit Apple-S instead of Cx-Cs.  Need a shell?  Mx shell.  Need a browser?  [W3][w3].

#### Read about Emacs
My biggest problem with Emacs is that I have very little idea what it's capable of.  In the months that I have dabbled it appears that [it can do anything][xkcd].  That knowledge is not extremely helpful however as I have some practical goals that need to be addressed (e.g. [IDE-ness][jide], <a href="http://orgmode.org/">notetaking</a>, etc...).  I have to really sit down and do some research these issues.

#### Extend Emacs
I had written a [stupid little minor mode][bmode] for my hobby language [Broccoli](/projects/broccoli) and have found the available references on creating minor/major modes in Emacs much akin to drinking flaming Bacardi 151[^8]... from a firehose.  To a n00b, everyone seems like an expert.

#### Stop complaining
'nuff said.

[^1]: A quick search on SF.net will dredge up tons of lame-ass editors.
[^2]: To be fair, I'm sure that EDT was a great editor at one time, but I grew up during the birth of ubiquitous computing and things like VMS seem akin to unicorns and elbow witches.
[^3]: Rolling your own gap buffer is something every first year CS student should do right?
[^4]: Sometimes I just sit and yearn.
[^5]: It stills sits in an old CVS repo... the bitwise equivalent of purgatory
[^6]: There's no crying in Emacs.
[^7]: I feel that the amount of time that I spend moving my hand from keyboard to mouse accounts for 13% of my day.  This is really ridiculously inefficient given that I already feel like I have ADD induced by the constant stream of Internets chattering.
[^8]: Bacardi 151 is for me the epitome of evil.  Any *brown* liquor is evil, but 151 is like the gaping maw of Satan devouring my soul.
