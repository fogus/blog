* [The Zen of Palm](http://designingmlearning.com/resources/ZenOfPalm.pdf) - Once upon a time there was a company called Palm that revolutionized the PDA industry by taking a step back an radically simplifying the user experience.

* I've been exploring the world of "podcasts" and have found (via [@warrenellis](http://www.twitter.com/warrenellis)) a bevy of music-related ones, including: [Ambient Sound Bath](http://ambientsoundbath.com/), [Sadayatana](http://sadayatana.com/), [Mantis Archives](http://darkfloor.co.uk/mantisarchives/), [Gizeh](https://soundcloud.com/gizeh), [Dronecast](http://www.the-drone.com/magazine/dronecast), [Radio Etiopia](http://radioetiopia.podomatic.com/), [Future Astronauts](https://futureastronauts.net/), [Drone Existence](http://drone-existence.com/audio.html), [Zoviet France](http://zovietfrance.podbean.com/), [Chants Beneath](http://chantsbeneath.podomatic.com/), and [Hypnagogue](https://hypnagoguepodcast.com/).  I like to have music playing as I code, but I've found over time I've become distracted by "songs with lyrics", so a fresh source of ambient, chant, and drone music is welcomed.
