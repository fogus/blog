* [The 25 best Films of the 21st Century and where to watch them](http://lifehacker.com/the-25-best-films-of-the-21st-century-and-where-to-wat-1787365947) -- Many great choices here.  This list makes me realize that I'm too far behind the curve of modern cinema.

* [Static typing will not save us from broken software](http://www.drmaciver.com/2016/10/static-typing-will-not-save-us-from-broken-software/)

* [Here's what I learned about Jullian Assage while working along side him](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/heres-what-i-learned-about-julian-assange) -- I thought the NDA was a nice twist.

* [Why I won't be attending Systems We Love](https://blog.valerieaurora.org/2016/10/22/why-i-wont-be-attending-systems-we-love/) -- a Valerie Aurora's story about inclusion and environments that stifle it.  While the post focuses on a single person, I read him as the archetype of a particular pernicious motif in tech. I would love to see a follow-up about the unnamed, warm systems engineer as positive archetype.

* [Tiny Lisp Computer 2](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1INT=) -- This is the kind of project that makes me yearn to hardware hack.

* [Literate DevOps](http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html) -- I've grown away from Literate Programming over time, but I do think that a case could be made for the value of "Literate" in other technical endeavors.

* [Why is that company so big? I could do that in a weekend](http://danluu.com/sounds-easy/)
