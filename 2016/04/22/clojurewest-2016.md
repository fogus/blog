For a while I considered the possibility of attending [Clojure/West 2016](http://clojurewest.org/), but frankly I'd grown tired of technical conferences.  At one point in my life I loved every moment of every conference that I'd ever attended, but over time I've grown tired of the whole experience.  First, I'm quite shy by nature and have never felt terribly comfortable putting myself out there and engaging in the typical hallway and post-conference festival of affectations.  I've always felt more at home with a small gathering of friends and so I didn't really consider going to the conference this year.  However, I'd never visited Seattle before, so I decided that I would take a few days to go with my family and explore the city during the after-conference hours.  This exploration of that beautiful city was spectacular, but it was during the conference hours that I found myself pleasantly surprised.

## Day 1

The first talk of the conference was "*[Specter: Powerful and Simple Data Structure Manipulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTCy_DkAJGk)*" by [Nathan Marz](https://twitter.com/nathanmarz).  [Specter](https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter) is a library that provides fast path-based data access and transformation utilities.  I've not had the privilege to dig deep into it, but it seems like an impressive piece of engineering.  That is, while the basic concept takes 40 lines of code to implement, the real challenge is making the concept fast, which Nathan was able to do.  I can't wait to really try it out.  That said, I want to make a quick point.  The library is billed as "Clojure's missing feature" and numerous times in conversation with others the point was made that they'd love to see Specter integrated into Clojure's core.  While I can see the justification for this sentiment, one of the reasons that we use a Lisp is that **we don't need Specter in core** -- it works perfectly well as a library.  Indeed, the beauty of Lisp is such that libraries are fully privileged with regard to any other language construct (save for special forms), including those found in the core.  Therefore, my rebuttal is that Lisp in general and Clojure in particular enables the perspective: more libraries / less core.

Every conference needs at least one case-study and "*[Managing One of the World's Largest Clojure Code Bases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUC7noGU1mQ)*" by Donevan Dolby was a pretty good one.  He discussed some of the sticking points around managing a large codebase (~16K LoC) all of which are true and real and I encourage you to watch the video for the precise details.  The most interesting part of the talk for me however was the mention that Clojure is on Boeing's list of approved languages.  That was a nice surprise.

One of my favorite talks of the conference was "*[Creating DSLs - A tale of spec-tacular success and failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO67QNn9hPY)*" by [Claire Alvis](https://twitter.com/chckadee).  In the presentation Claire talks about a library named [spec-tacular](https://github.com/SparkFund/spec-tacular) that she and her company [SparkFund](https://www.sparkfund.co/) created that adds some static and run-time guarantees to their [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/) database access via some hardcore macrology.  The most interesting thing about the talk was that Claire took time to define the characteristics of a good Clojure (though the criteria applies generally) library and then graded spec-tacular against them.  Some characteristics were successfully met while others were not, but the real take-away from the talk was that she's clearly thought long and hard about this topic and even still her library only partially meets the criteria.  This really drives home the fact that while we may have idealized models of "good software" the realities of production needs often impinge on them in unexpected ways due to very real trade-offs.  I traditionally despise "library talks" because they very seldom discuss the trade-offs involved in the development and use of said library, but Claire's was a breath of fresh air.  Spec-tacular is not an idealized library, but it solves a very real problem for SparkFund in a very specific way and Claire did a masterful job of highlighting the trade-offs inherent in its construction.

After lunch I attended a [Cognitect](http://www.cognitect.com) Q&A in the anticipation that I might have something to contribute (I was wrong).  There were a lot of good discussion around the practical use of Datomic and if you're interested in using it then it's a good video to check out.

### Diversity

"*[ClojureBridge in Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjIUyUFOHhA)*" by [Katherine Fellows](https://twitter.com/kf) and [Anna Pawlicka](https://twitter.com/AnnaPawlicka) was the first talk in a series of similarly themed talks around community growth and diversification.  Let's be honest, the diversity numbers in the Clojure community are not great.  I hesitate to posit why this is the case, but I can say that there are many people[^thanks] putting a lot of effort into diversifying the current stark homogenous makeup of the community.  There's still a lot of work to do to build a community that can foster the creativity of people of varying perspectives, but things are better than they've ever been and look to continue along a positive trajectory.  **This is a great thing.**  Both [Alex Miller](http://www.twitter.com/puredanger) and [Lynn Grogan](https://twitter.com/lynngrogan), the organizers of the conference, have worked tirelessly to ensure a wider representation of people across all demographics, including people with very diverse backgrounds, both cultural and professional.  [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) is an amazing effort and absolutely an essential part of the Clojure ecosystem.

[^thanks]: People including, but certainly not limited to: The two speakers Katherine Fellows and Anna Pawlicka, other ClojureBridge organizers and supporters like Yoko Harada, Bhaskar Mookerji, David Chambers, and Malwine Gier, sponsors and organizers of the LGBTQIA Lunch and Lambda Ladies Dinner, and of course those in the Clojure community who have supported these efforts.

Speaking of which, another of my favorite talks of the conference was "*[Deepen and Diversify the Clojure Community with Jr Engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOIhncWcCjA)*" by [Amie Kuttruff](https://twitter.com/amiekuttruff).  In the talk she told anecdotes about her experience as a "junior engineer" and her growth as a Clojure programmer fostered by thoughtful mentorship.  She made a fantastic point about the fact that very often what makes learning so difficult is that people come to a new topic without even a basic context needed to begin exploration.  I can only speak for myself when I say that I sometimes forget what it was like to not know how to program.  But looking back on the beginning, there were many times when I knew so little about the topic that I didn't have the basic contextual vocabulary[^context] to even formulate questions.  This is a bootstrapping problem that's particularly pernicious in programming because from the outside it seems incredibly difficult and ponderously mathematical and appears to move fast and on top of all of that is collectively impatient (or downright repellent to) with people from non-technical backgrounds.  This is incredibly intimidating.  It takes patient and thoughtful mentorship to effectively guide people to become not only effective learners but also invaluable members of a programming community and workplace.  There are many people in the world who're drawn to programming for any number of personal reasons and we as a programming community would do well to tap into that interest to help grow and enable others to benefit, and benefit from, our industry.
