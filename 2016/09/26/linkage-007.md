* [Lost mainframe games](https://bluerenga.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/lost-mainframe-games/) -- Mythical and legendary old computer games that have been lost to the dustbin of history... or have they... apparently a version of ["Wander" has been recently unearthed](https://ahopeful.wordpress.com/2015/04/22/wander-1974-a-lost-mainframe-game-is-found/).

* [Books for Inform Designers](http://inform-fiction.org/manual/) -- Inform7 is one of the most fascinating programming languages that I've ever come across.

Of course, I also recommend the great book *[Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform7](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Interactive-Fiction-Inform-7/dp/1435455061/?tag=fogus-20)*.

* [How to Clean Slate and Shell Go Stones](https://erythen.wordpress.com/2015/09/23/how-to-clean-slate-and-shell-go-stones/)
