The title of this post is intentionally misleading.  Kris Burm, for those of you unfamiliar with him, is a game designer[^1] responsible for a highly praised series of abstract strategy games called [Project GIFP](http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/project_GIPF).  In [an interview given circa 2000 Burm](http://web.archive.org/web/20040520200126/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/iview/burm_abstract.html) describes the challenges of game designers like himself who create purely thinking games without a theme.[^2]  The interesting aspect of this interview is that with a well-executed SED command the post could be made to refer to the challenges facing non-mainstream programming language designers.  For example:

> The biggest problem you face when introducing a new abstract game, 
> is how to make a player aware of the difference between a good move 
> and a bad move. Most will get the impression of wasting time if 
> they don't start having a clue about what to do after, let’s 
> say, two games. If the click hasn't come by then, most will never 
> start a third game.

Could be changed to:

> The biggest problem you face when introducing a new 
> programming language,  is how to make a programmer aware of the 
> difference between a gem and a kludge. Most will get 
> the impression of wasting time if they don't start having a

Over the past few months I've become fascinated with the game design space and over and again I run into aspects that mirror the computing industry.

:F

[^2]: As an illustration, consider the difference between Monopoly (heavily themed) and Go (no theme).
