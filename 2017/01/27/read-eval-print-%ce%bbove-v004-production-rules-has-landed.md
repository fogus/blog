It's been a long time coming, but I've finally put the finishing touches on the latest installment of my Read-Eval-Print-λove zine, this time focusing on production rules.

This installment will deal with production rules, their purpose and implementation as well as an exploration into rules-driven OOP, data, and extracting ourselves from the Tarpit. Plus, I list my 100 favorite Jazz albums.

Some important links are below:

 * The landing page for REP&lt;3 is at <http://www.readevalprintlove.org>
 * The Ebooks for v004 (for a nominal fee[^fee]) are at <https://leanpub.com/readevalprintlove004>
 * The complete text for v004 is at <https://leanpub.com/readevalprintlove004/read>
 * The source text for all installments are (eventually) at <https://github.com/readevalprintlove/readevalprintlove>

Remember that all installments are considered living documents and can and will change for the better based on feedback from readers.

[^fee]: I offer [ebook versions of Read-Eval-Print-λove through LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/u/fogus) (i.e. PDF, MOBI and EPUB).  The price is very low, but I'd appreciate it very much of you can find it in your heart to give more.

I hope you'll enjoy.
