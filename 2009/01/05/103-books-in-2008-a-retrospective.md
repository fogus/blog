2008 was a very strange year.  Aside from the birth of my second child, I was somehow struck with an unquenchable desire to read.  I have always been a heavy reader, but never like this.  103 books?  It seems excessive but somehow I managed to pull it off.  In addition to the books listed below, I should mention that I also read the same 7 Dr. Seuss books to my first boy a combined 643 times, but I didn't think it was worth adding them to my list.  What did reading 103 books teach me?  The short answer is, *I will probably never do that again*.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy doing so, but in order to read 103 books in a year one has to spend an inordinate amount of time reading dreck, and after doing so for so many hours in the past year I am determined to never repeat it... if I can help it.  I resolve to do better at choosing my reading in the future (and in all likelihood, I will be [writing more code](http://github.com/fogus) in my free time).  Therefore, 2009 will likely pale in comparison in sheer numbers; although I hope to read more life-changing material.  That being said, let me list a few high (and low) points of my reading last year:

Best book
---------
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/676737.Grendel?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=grid_widget" title="Grendel"><img alt="Grendel" border="0" src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1177038401s/676737.jpg" width="39" /></a>

*Grendel* 
Truly a fantastic book.  It was the kind of beautifully written book that shames me that I ever had the gall to try and put pen to paper. 

Worst book
----------
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79076.Monster_Nation?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=grid_widget" title="Monster Nation (Zombies, Book 2)"><img alt="Monster Nation" border="0" src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1170963898s/79076.jpg" width="39" /></a>

*Monster Nation*
I think I have worn out the novelty of the Zombie fiction book.  In reality, it was probably not as bad as I remember, but it just happen to be the last zombie book that I may ever read.  

Hidden gem
----------
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2224813.The_Survivors?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=grid_widget" title="The Survivors"><img alt="The Survivors" border="0" src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1215091303s/2224813.jpg" width="39" /></a>

*The Survivors*
I picked up a really old copy of this book at a local used book shop for two-bits and really didn't expect much from it.  However, it was a very pleasant find and is a gritty story way ahead of its time.

Biggest disappointment
----------------------
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024.Anathem?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=grid_widget" title="Anathem"><img alt="Anathem" border="0" src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1224107150s/2845024.jpg" width="39" /></a>

*Anathem*
I was really psyched about Stephenson's latest book and for the first 150 pages I enjoyed it thoroughly; unfortunately the book is 937 pages.  I think that XKCD summed up my qualms with the book:

Best tech book
-------------- 
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1741472.Programming_Collective_Intelligence_Building_Smart_Web_2_0_Applications?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=grid_widget" title="Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications"><img alt="Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications" border="0" src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1187645251s/1741472.jpg" width="39" /></a>

*Programming Collective Intelligence*
A really good technical book that talks about how to apply "machine learning" [^ml] to "Web 2.0".  It contains just enough detail without inundating the reader with material more appropriate for a PhD dissertation.
