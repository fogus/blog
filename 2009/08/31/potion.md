So I agreed to maintain why the Lucky Stiff's [source code repository](http://github.com/fogus/potion) for the [Potion programming language](http://fogus.me/projects/potion), but I'm not sure what, if anything, I will do to it.  Initially I plan to gather as much documentation as possible, but thereafter ... who knows.  Maybe I will try to implement the missing features in-place as listed by _why himself, but I am currently leaning towards locking down the current implementation as an historic artifact and simply encourage forks for additional functionality.  We'll see.  I've created a [Potion discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/potion-lang) for these and other topics, so feel free to throw in your own $0.02.
