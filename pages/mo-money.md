A long time ago I made a decision to not clutter my blog with Google Adwords, Amazon shelves, and other advertising noise.  However, I work hard to write interesting posts and believe that I provide a useful service for some.  While I try to link to freely available information when possible, I occasionally use affiliate links for my own book *[The Joy of Clojure](http://joyofclojure.com)* and books that I link to on this site.  I make very little money off of these links, but over time I accumulate enough for a free book or two.  If you think this site and blog are worth a couple free books a year for me, then the affiliate links are at your disposal.  However, if the idea of affiliate links offends you, then simply remove the part of the URL listed as `tag=fogus-20` before clicking through to Amazon.

In any case, thanks for visiting.
:F
