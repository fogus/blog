Great blog posts read

* [My favorite Erlang program](http://joearms.github.io/2013/11/21/My-favorite-erlang-program.html) -- *When Joe Armstrong blogs about his favorite Erlang program, you read it.  There is no debate here.*

* [Operating System Development Series](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html) -- *I am an absolute sucker when it comes to OSDev articles.*

* [Internal Reprogrammability](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InternalReprogrammability.html) -- *Fowler does it again.  And again. And again.*

* [Exponential Decay of History, Improved](http://awelonblue.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/exponential-decay-of-history-improved/) -- *David Barbour improves on an idea that was already a very good idea to start.  The [original](http://awelonblue.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/exponential-decay-of-history/) are solid reads.* [^sim]

* [Wodehouse Saved My Life](http://www.pgwodehousebooks.com/lauriesaved.htm) -- *Hugh Laurie discusses Wodehouse.*

* [On Software Architecture](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/on-software-architecture) -- *Software architecture (and architects) are at times much maligned.  The view of the architect is becoming less vitriolic as the Internet forces a focus on architecture, but many poseurs have worked to taint the view of, in my opinion, a crucial role in modern software shops.  Roy Fielding posted a while back about architecture in a way that really crystalized my understanding of the value.* [^arch]

* [Carver Mead: The Spectator Interview](http://freespace.virgin.net/ch.thompson1/People/CarverMead.htm) -- *This is an article that takes a few re-reads to really hit home.*

* [Dear Leader Dreams of Sushi](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201306/kim-jong-il-sushi-chef-kenji-fujimoto-adam-johnson-2013?printable=true) -- *an astonishing article about Kim Jong-il's obsessiong with sushi and the man who helped sate it*

* [JavaScript Isn't Scheme](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/07/18/javascript-isnt-scheme/) -- *I'd read Nystrom blog on just about any topic, but this one is his best of 2013 IMO*

* [The Genre Artist](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19Vance-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=5&) -- *an article about Jack Vance, a great, but under-appreciated scifi writer.*

* [Ruins of Forgotten Empires](http://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/ruins-of-forgotten-empires-apl-languages/) -- *an article about the APL family of programming languages*

* [Simon Stalenhag's art](http://www.simonstalenhag.se/index.html) -- *beautiful retro-futuristic paintings*

* [Dig Deep: Beyond Lean-in](http://thefeministwire.com/2013/10/17973/) -- *Bell Hooks on modern feminism and the Lean-in principle*

* [Andrew Looney's Eleven Principles of Game Design](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Andy/Games/DesignPrinciples.html) -- *Quite possibly the game designer that I admire the most, on game design*

* [Rediscovering Checkers](http://www.bobnewell.net/checkers/rediscover2.html) -- *a gentleman describes "scientific checkers"*

* [Chuck Moore's Creations](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ashleyf/archive/2013/09/21/chuck-moores-creations.aspx) -- One of my favorite talks at [Strange Loop 2013 conference](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions) was Moore's talk entitled *[Programming a 144-computer Chip to Minimize Power](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/power-144-chip).  In that talk he describes the gritty details of effectively bootstrapping a [GreenArray parallel processing board](http://www.greenarraychips.com/) using a version of colorForth.  The language and the board shown by Moore were a revelation to me.  I started my career working in the guts of machines using an oscilloscope as my debugging environment and Moore's creations made me yearn for that experience once again.[^film]

[^sim]: As someone with a background in simulation I've felt that David's idea has a real place in sim.  However, I've not been able to put them to the test yet.

[^film]: As a kid I vaguely remember a movie about some kid who had a computer that ran on a 9-volt battery who could write code that generated these materialized force-bubbles.  He used these force bubbles for all kinds of fun activities but mostly to fly to space and visit aliens.  I believe that computer ran a GreenArray and was programmed via colorForth. Does anyone remember this film?  My memory and Google-fu fails me.

[^arch]: While Fielding's post helped, working closely with unbelievable architects like Tim Ewald, [Russ Olsen](http://blog.russolsen.com/) and [Michael Nygard](http://michaelnygard.com/) truly imprinted the desire to incorporate architectural thinking into my own software processes.
