<center>*this is my first post in a [series](http://blog.fogus.me/tag/confo) leading up to [Clojure/West and the Confo](http://clojurewest.org/)*</center>

If you follow [my Twitterings](http://www.twitter.com/fogus) then you might already know that [Chouser](http://n01se.net/chouser/) and I are working on the [2nd edition](http://www.joyofclojure.com/2nd) of [The Joy of Clojure](http://www.joyofclojure.com).[^1]  There are big changes coming mostly by way of additions since much has happened since Clojure 1.3.  Below you'll find the tentative new table of contents.

</pre>

In addition to the new chapters, we plan to go back in time and tighten existing examples and explanations and perform a general update of content based on new features.  Finally, Chouser and I have been using Clojure and ClojureScript at our jobs for quite a while and have learned a lot about the language and how to use it.  In this 2nd edition we plan to share what we've learned... for greater good.  Finally, one thing that hasn't changed is that Joy will continue to be the "next" book on Clojure, focusing on not just the "how", but also the "why" of the language.

Keep an eye out here and at [Manning's Joy page](http://www.manning.com/fogus) for more information.

*If you're interested in talking about the book, the 1st edition and it's plans for the 2nd edition, then find me at the [Confo, and  Clojure/West](http://clojurewest.org/sessions#confo) -- it stands to be a grand time. You can still [register for Clojure/West and the Confo](http://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1172220), but act fast.*

:F

[^1]: We have a scheduled release, but I hesitate to mention it now because we'd like to provide the best possible book that we're capable of writing.  Let's just say that we'll be done when we're happy with what we wrote. :-)
