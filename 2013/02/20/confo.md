A little less than a month from today the [Clojure/West](http://clojurewest.org/sessions) conference takes place in Portland, OR.  I attended the first Clojure/West and [actually gave a talk entitled ClojureScript Anatomy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/ClojureScript).  This year however I'm not presenting, but I'll still be there.

*tl;dr The Conf° collocated with [Clojure/West](http://clojurewest.org/) is happening on the evening of Tues Mar. 19th and is only $50 to attend. [Register before it's too late](http://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1172220).*

My role at this year's Clojure/West will be the emcee of the very exciting mini-conference *The Conf°* ([only $50 to attend; register now](http://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1172220)).  If you're not familiar with the point of *The Conf°* then the easy explanation is that it's about different aspects of relational logic using [miniKanren](http://minikanren.org/).  miniKanren has generated a lot of excitement in the Clojure community thanks to David Nolen's implementation in [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) and the amazing presentations by the authors of the definitive[^def] reference on the subject *[The Reasoned Schemer](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reasoned-schemer)* -- [Daniel Friedman and William Byrd](http://blip.tv/clojure/dan-friedman-and-william-byrd-minikanren-5936333).

While the larger [Clojure/West conference looks very exciting, including three days of awesomeness](http://clojurewest.org/schedule), *The Conf°* will be a quaint affair devoted to the wonders of miniKanren.  However, as the schedule below shows, the focus is not entirely on Clojure.  On tap for the evening is a healthy dose of not only Clojure goodness, but also Scheme, Haskell and maybe even something new:

* Introduction and hello by Me
* Logic programming in the wild by Gabriel Pickard
* Intro to CLP with core.logic by Ryan Senior
* Molog: Typed Functional Logic Programming in Haskell by Adam Foltzer
* The Architecture of core.logic by David Nolen
* core.logic.nominal by Nada Amin
* The Unreasonable Schemers by Dan Friedman and William Byrd

I can't wait to join the fun.  I hope to see you there too.

In the meantime, below you'll find more information to help you gear up for *The Conf°*.

:F

[^def]: TRS is currently the *only* reference on miniKanren, but [I know of another book in development that will cover the topic too](http://www.joyofclojure.com/2nd).
