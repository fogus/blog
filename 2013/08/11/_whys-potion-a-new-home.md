In August of 2009 [I assumed the role of maintainer of the Potion programming language](http://blog.fogus.me/2009/08/31/potion/) created by [_why the Lucky Stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff).  Over the past 4 years I've performed maintenance, added features and managed patches to the codebase.  While I've always enjoyed the language and the codebase itself, I never viewed that language as truly mine.[^z]  As a result I probably have not done as much as I could have for Potion given the proper motivation.

I've been on the lookout for someone intelligent, motivated and responsive to queries to assume control of _why's creation -- that person is [Reini Urban](https://github.com/rurban).

Therefore, starting from this day forward the Potion repository and maintenance will fall under [Reini's Github organization](https://github.com/perl11).  If you have forks and patches then you should update your repository links to the new location:[^gh]

<https://www.github.com/perl11/potion>

It's been an honor and a pleasure to help keep Potion alive over the past 4 years.  Exciting times are ahead for the language and I have every confidence that Reini will blow our minds.

[^gh]: Although Github will forward the old links, I'm not sure how long this will work.

[^z]: Where _why zigged I might have zagged, and all that.  Regardless, it was his sweat that made it, not mine.
