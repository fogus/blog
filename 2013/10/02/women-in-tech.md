Suggestions welcomed in the comments.[^5]

[^1]: My wife is a woman in tech and I try my best to listen and learn from her, but I can do better.

[^5]: I realize that exclusion in tech is not limited to matters of gender, but I chose to focus on it here because it hits close to home *for me*.  I would love to learn more about exclusionary practices along racial, religious and class lines also.  Please comment if you know some good sources worth exploring.
