1. The 1st law of thermo-dumb-antics[^1] states that in a buzzword-riddled startup landscape all disruption cancels out to form a mediocrity.
2. The 2nd law of thermo-dumb-antics describes a condition where the brainpower in a pitch meeting dissipates as heat rather than as good ideas.
3. The 3rd law of thermo-dumb-antics states that if marketing material mentions the word "disrupt" then there's no way that disruption will result from said marketed wares.
4. The 4th law of thermo-dumb-antics states that any conference with "distrupt" in its name is more likely to disrupt other hotel guests located near the conference block than its relevant industry.
