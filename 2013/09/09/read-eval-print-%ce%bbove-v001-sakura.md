I just hit GO on the Read-Eval-Print-位ove newsletter, so if you [subscribed to the newsletter](http://www.readevalprintlove.org/subscribe) then it should hit your inbox very soon.  For those of you who have not heard about it yet, the elevator pitch is as follows:

> Read-Eval-Print-位ove is a bi-monthly newsletter of original content and 
> curation about the Lisp family of programming languages and little-languages in general.

Additionally, I offer [ebook versions of Read-Eval-Print-位ove through LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/readevalprintlove001) (i.e. PDF, MOBI and EPUB).  The price is very low, but I'd appreciate it very much of you can find it in your heart to give more.
