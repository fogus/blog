<br /><font class="comment">Next to Yon-Sama, the "MatsuKen Samba" was the craziest pop-culture fixture during my trip to Japan.  It was a social phenomenon.  The song rang throughout the streets day and night.  Every available advertising space not filled by Yon-Sama was instead occupied by Matsudaira-san.  </font>
