1) OSX-Stud <a href="http://kernelthread.com">Amit Singh</a> has written an interesting article on Apple Powerbooks' Sudden Motion Sensor and its <a href="http://kernelthread.com/software/ams2hid/">application to interface design</a>.  If you haven't had a chance to check out any of his previous KernelThread articles, I'd recommend startingout with "<a href="http://kernelthread.com/mac/osx/">What is Mac OS X?</a>".<br /><br />2) <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/">ACM Queue</a> has a pretty interesting interview with <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=282">Tim Bray</a> of XML fame.  <br /><br />3) The rumors of a <a href="http://www.superunprivileged.org/">GNU/Hurd LiveCD</a> have been greatly exagerrated.  In fact, the LiveCD in question is only a work in progress and may fail if attempted.  However, for those curious about the state of a GNU/Hurd LiveCD, perhaps one of the following links will suffice:<br />- <a href="http://gnuppix.org/">Gnuppix</a><br />- <a href="http://people.debian.org/~neal/FOSDEM-2005/">The State of Affairs</a><br />- <a href="http://archive.daniel-baumann.ch/temporary/hurd-live-cd.iso.gz">Mirror of above ISO</a><br />- <a href="http://www.hup.hu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8359">Screenshots</a><br /><br />-m
