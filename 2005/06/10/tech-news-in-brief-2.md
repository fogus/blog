<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/06/10/japan.robots.ap/index.html">CNN.com - Japan drums up robot support - Jun 10, 2005</a>: "One model called Batting Robot has a vision system that handles 1,000 images a second, more than 30 times the human eye, allowing it to accurately hit pitches of up to 160 kph (100 mph). At the expo, however, it was using a plastic bat to hit rubber balls at far slower speeds."

This new, 'completely revamped' dual-core architecture will supposedly give a 20-30% performance boost over the current Pentium M and will be the nail in the coffin of the power-inefficient Netburst architecture. I think Conroe is the most likely candidate for the first Intel-based PowerMac, because it would allow Apple to skip Netburst entirely."

<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=23055">Intel panics and announces Merom</a>: "The chips themselves throw out the failed P4 'Netbust' architecture and are based on the Pentium M philosophy of shorter and more efficient pipelines. I have heard 12 or 13 stages from several people. Don't look for clock speeds anywhere near that of Netburst products, more in the 2.5GHz range for the desktop parts."
