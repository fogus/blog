At least one helicopter was used in the operation. The scale of the police response was apparently due to the ineffectiveness of a smaller force used in the previous 'Sequence Five' rave. Prior to dispersing the partiers, several police informants had reportedly infiltrated the rave and observed widespread illegal activities."
