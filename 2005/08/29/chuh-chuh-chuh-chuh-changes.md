Having gone into one of my periodic blog-posting funks recently, I had decided to change the way that I handle my postings.  That is, I no longer have the desire to maintain a blog containing nothing but collections of links to other sites' articles.  There is nothing inherently exciting about that approach.  Instead, I hope to first make a clean cut from Blogger in leu of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and then to simply use that webspace as purely original postings.  Of course, I fully expect that space to have less frequent updates, but at least it is something that I can look back on 10 years from now and know what I was thinking... not just what I happened to be reading on the net.  I am still trying to compile a list of postable topics, but preliminary ruminations have produced the following:

+ Dreams: I enjoy reading <a href="http://blog.founddrama.net">FD</a>'s offerings, and plan on completely ripping it off

+ Personal Project Updates: I have about 6 different programming projects that I am juggling at any giving time.  This space would be a great place to create a developer's notebook updating the state of each.

+ Thoughts on medium consumption: Thoughts and notes on books, movies, news, etc... that I may have found interesting (or wretched).

+ Travel Log: Nuff said.

+ Ideas for stuff: What would I do if... scenarios.

+ Interesting Interviews with Interesting People: The hope is to provide original interviews... but most likely will contain the best of the best from people I find brilliant, whacky, or a combination of the two.

What will NOT be seen on the new webspace:

- News of the Weird
- Tech news in brief
- Reading Queues
- Anything not spawned from mine mind (exceptions to be determined on a whim)

That is all I have at the moment.  Any reader suggestions will first be scoffed, then stolen as original ideas.
