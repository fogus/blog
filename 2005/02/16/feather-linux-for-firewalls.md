<a href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2005/02/10/instant_firewall.html">LinuxDevCenter.com: Feather Linux for Firewalls</a>: "Feather Linux makes it easy to create and configure a firewall. When would you do this? Consider setting up an ad hoc network for a LAN party or a trade show, where you want a good connection to the internet but don't want to expose everything on the local network to the world at large. Having a customizable, bootable LiveCD makes it easy to turn any single machine into the firewall."
