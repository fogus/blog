<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/pa-bigiron1/?ca=dgr-lnxw16BigIron">Big iron lessons: FPU architecture, now and then</a>: "Learning about the technological evolution of the IBM mainframe architecture can help system architects make key decisions for embedded and SoC (system-on-chip) architectures. This article is the first in the Big iron lessons series, which explores elements of the IBM mainframe architecture. The series assists developers who build new architectures by examining the design decisions made in the big iron mainframes leading up to today's z990. This first article gives background information on the evolution of floating point standards and acceleration developed for IBM mainframes and summarizes significant design decisions that led up to the current z990 Floating Point Unit (FPU). Future article topics include RAS (reliability and serviceability), security, power management, and thermal control."
