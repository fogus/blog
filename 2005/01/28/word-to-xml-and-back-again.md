<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/08/word-to-xml.html">XML.com: Word to XML and Back Again</a>: "In this article, I will show you how to take the frighteningly messy result of Word's 'Save as Web Page' and turn it into well-formed XML, using a few lines of Python and a touch of XSLT.

<br />
<br />python wordconverter.py mydoc.htm > mydoc.xml
<br />
<br />python wordconverter.py mydoc.xml > mynewdoc.htm"
