<a href="http://ski.ihoc.net/">The Most Officialest SkiFree Home Page</a>: "In 1991 I was working at Microsoft as a programmer, writing programming utilities for use by other programmers, such as a dialog editor used in the development of Word and Excel.  I programmed mostly in C for OS/2 (back then that was a Microsoft product, and supposedly the wave of the future).  Deciding it was time to learn Windows programming (Windows 3.0 had just come out) I jumped right in and did a graphical version of my old VAX/VMS skiing game for VT100 terminals."
