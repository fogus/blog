<br />Yuki has finally found an iPod to lust over. Our new addition should arrive within a week... barring any shipping delays (that neeeever happens with Apple).  Here's how the transaction went after hitting "Complete Checkout":
<br />
<br /><i>Yuki</i>: Hmmm, maybe I should have paid the extra $90 to get the iPod mini instead.
<br /><i>Mike</i>: Well, why don't we get the iPod Shuffle and try it out.  If you find that you don't like it then I will buy it from you and you can get the mini.
<br /><i>Yuki</i>: OK.
<br />
<br />I am such a good husband... very altruistic.  ;)
