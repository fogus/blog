<p>I knew the day would end oddly when I took my first bite of a creature called a Turducken. Apparently, some scientists bred a duck with a chicken and then with a turkey and a pig (or something like that) and then removed the dna sequence for bones. The result was a truly sadistic Thanksgiving meal that actually tasted pretty damn good. Weird. I guess scientifically mutated animals taste better than the ones that God created. It&#8217;s like those giant tomatoes that can feed a colony of people; genetically engineered for sumptuosity.</p>
<p>It was nice to see my sister too.<br />
