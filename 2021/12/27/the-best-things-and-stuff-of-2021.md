Great things and people that I discovered, learned, read, met, etc. in 2021.  No particular ordering is implied.  Not everything is new.

## Great posts | articles | talks read/watched

* *[A Short History of Objective-C](https://medium.com/chmcore/a-short-history-of-objective-c-aff9d2bde8dd)* - *Sadly, [Brad Cox passed away in 2021](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/scnow/name/brad-cox-obituary?pid=197454225). Years ago he participated in a fantastic [oral history](https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/07/102717175-05-01-acc.pdf) (pdf) -- RIP my old [office-mate](http://blog.fogus.me/2003/10/21/24/).*
* *[The Birthplace of AI: The 1956 Dartmouth Workshop](https://www.cantorsparadise.com/the-birthplace-of-ai-9ab7d4e5fb00)* - *A wellspring of information around the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester. The post dives into [the proposal](https://github.com/fogus/papers-i-love/blob/master/artificial_intelligence/McCarthy-Dartmouth.pdf) and some of the prestigious attendees and their follow-on work. There's a [supplemental article at AAAI](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1911) that's worth reading as well. This post motivated me to [imagine a world](https://github.com/fogus/thunks/blob/main/studies/lispm-futurism.txt) in which these ideas took hold of the computing universe and didn't ever let go. This is a work in progress and may never find completion but it's been fun so far.*
* *[J notation as a tool of thought](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/)* - *In addition to providing a great introduction to [J](https://www.jsoftware.com), Hillel Wayne also touches on the underlying philosophies underpinning APL and J.*
* *[Introducing the Smalltalk Zoo](https://computerhistory.org/blog/introducing-the-smalltalk-zoo-48-years-of-smalltalk-history-at-chm/)* - *A nice condensed history of Smalltalk with links and videos along the way. More importantly, the post talks about the [ Welcome to the Smalltalk Zoo](https://smalltalkzoo.thechm.org), a collection of Smalltalk information, emulations, and various other bits of knowledge curated by Dan Ingalls.*
* *[Bootstrapping a minimal math library](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2021/01/05/bootstrapping-math-library/)* - *This was a simple post and I'm certain that most mathematicians already knew this information. However, I am not a mathematician and so the revelations were deeply interesting to me. I instantly ran off and started implementing the ideas in [my own little language playground](https://github.com/fogus/tori-lisp).[^math]*
* *[The Kubrick Gaze](https://realitysandwich.com/the-kubrick-gaze/)* - *JF Martel spends buckets of ink (so to speak) about Kubrick's filmatic device of focusing in an a character's face as it stares deeply into the camera. There is a surprising amount of depth behind something seemingly so simple.*
* *[A Close Look at a Spinlock](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/2173)* - *A deep deep dive into the workings of the spinlock mutual exclusion primitive. It's been a long time since I thought about spinlocks and it was surprising how much I had forgotten -- and what I didn't know in the first place.*
* *[Uptime 15,364 days - The Computers of Voyager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H62hZJVqs2o)* - *There are few hobbies better than spending years to completely understand the computing systems running Voyager 1 and 2. Great talk by [Aaron Cummings](https://twitter.com/btvaaron). The [references for the talk](https://github.com/aaroncummings/strange-loop-2019/blob/master/references.md) are amazing too.*

[^math]: I didn't finish however -- PRs welcomed.

## Most viewed blog posts by me

* *[Clojure Core](http://blog.fogus.me/2021/01/15/clojure-core/)* - *I [joined the Clojure core team](https://twitter.com/richhickey/status/1350110634776657920) on a full-time basis and posted about it. I've worked on Clojure [in my free-time for years](http://blog.fogus.me/tag/clojure/) and so the decision to join the team for my actual job was a no-brainer. I've always felt that Clojure the language was interesting but the forces that drove its design and creation were far more important. By working on Clojure full-time I feel that I can contribue something important (despite that my individual contributions may be humble) to the computing industry.*
* *[Clojure builds as an amalgamation of orthogonal parts](http://blog.fogus.me/2021/07/20/clojure-builds-as-an-amalgamation-of-orthogonal-parts/)* - *One of the first projects that I worked on after joining the core team was [tools.build](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build) and in this post I dove into it a bit.*
* *[Thunks](https://github.com/fogus/thunks)* - *I tend to either [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/fogus) nonsense or write long(ish) posts (i.e. longer nonsense) on my [blog](http://www.fogus.me/blog). In the background I tend to write notes in a notebook and transfer them as needed into post drafts. Instead of doing that, I'll likely use Thunks to hold notes in focused topics for (perhaps) future nonsense.*

## Favorite technical books discovered (and read)

* **[Software Design for Flexibility How to Avoid Programming Yourself into a Corner](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Design-Flexibility-Programming-Yourself/dp/0262045494/?tag=fogus-20)** by Chris Hanson Gerald Jay Sussman - *The best book on programming and programming practice written in years. Hanson and Sussman are on fire -- as if there was any doubt. I have a whole set of notes for this book centered around Clojure that I'd love to [Thunk](https://github.com/fogus/thunks) some day. Until then I will say that this is the advanced programming techniques-centric book that I've wanted for years. There is a deep focus on layered program construction, DSLs, propagator networks, non-determinism, and degeneracy[^deg], all of which are little covered in most computing texts. The schools of software architecture exposed in this book are informed by biological systems, symbolic AI, ambient behaviors, and the blood and sweat shed over the years developing functional programming systems. There's a plethora of wisdom contained in these pages and a lot of thinking required to fruitfully mine that wisdom to inform the construction of systems, but I think this process will be more than worth the effort.*
* **[Inside Macintosh](https://vintageapple.org/inside_o/)** - *I was fortunate to come across [a set](https://twitter.com/fogus/status/1466860740254609408) of [Inside Macintosh books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Macintosh) locally and it's a multi-year project of mine to work my way through them. The [first volume in the series](https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Macintosh-Vol-Apple-Computer/dp/0201177315/?tag=fogus-20) covers the Macintosh 128K, 512K, and XL models and their operating environments and I followed along with [my 512K](https://twitter.com/fogus/status/1189977550023516160) in tow. This book (and the series in general) are among the greatest technical references ever written. As a part of my day job ([and outside of it
