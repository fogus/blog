Earlier today Rich Hickey let the cat out of the bag that [I'm joining the Clojure Core](https://twitter.com/richhickey/status/1350110634776657920) development team.

This is a change from my previous relationship with the Clojure Core team that in the past few years has been sporadic at best. This circumstance arose through necessity rather than desire and so I'm overjoyed to work closely with the team once again. Over the past few years [Alex Miller](https://twitter.com/puredanger) has exerted a Herculean effort in shepherding the language through numerous versions and steady growth. I'm overjoyed to be given the opportunity to join him in helping push the language forward, and I'll do my very best to avoid breaking everything.

So what this means is that I'll be far more visible[^v] in and around the Clojure ecosystem while spending my time thinking about Clojure more so than just using Clojure.[^cljs]


[^v]: The range of online sources of Clojure-related chatter is quite daunting and my immediate goal is to establish some sort of tempo for interacting therein.

[^cljs]: I'm certainly willing to help with both [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) and [Clojure-CLR](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr), but those teams are rock solid and so my best move is probably just to stay out of the way.
