<strong> Write-Ins? </strong>

I have been unable to track down the top wite-in vote getters for the election, however I can probably guess.  In my area Nader was not on the official list, then it's clear that he was the write-in king here.  However, my guess for the remainder are:

1) Colin Powell

2) John McCain

3) Hillary Clinton

4) Michael Moore

5) The Mitrea
