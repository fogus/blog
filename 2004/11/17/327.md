<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/11/16/explorers.pacman/index.html">CNN.com - Pacman breaks out of the arcade - Nov 16, 2004</a>: "'The Human Pacman is basically a wearable computer with a head mounted display and various sensors which is sensing my body's position and as well as the head orientation so I know exactly where I am and what I'm looking at,' explains Cheok.

'So when we do this we can augment the real world with the virtual world, so the Pacman world becomes part of the real world. I can see cookies in front of me and I can collect them by walking through them.'"
