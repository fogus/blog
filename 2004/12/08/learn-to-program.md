<a href="http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach yourself programming in 10 years</a>
<br />
<br />Peter Norvig is absolutely correct in this essay.  I've been programming almost daily for about 12 years (although I was writing BASIC and Pascal programs to keep track of neighborhood baseball stats and RPG character generation between 8 and 16 years old).  For the past 5 years I have been doing it probably 50 hours a week.  However, no matter how good I think that I've gotten I manage to always find a topic and/or programmer that kicks my ass.  While it certainly is reasonable to think that after 10 years one might be considered an expert programmer, but the process never ends -- its the nature of the beast.

<br />As a side note, I should add that I find it ironic that it also takes at least 10 years to read and fully comprehend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0137903952/qid=1102535888/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-4933216-3389758?v=glance&s=books">Norvig's masterpiece</a>.
