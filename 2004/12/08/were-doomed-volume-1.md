<a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/10365007.htm?1c">Parents Television Council carries a big stick with FCC</a>: "In 2003, the year when complaints to the commission rose from 14,000 the previous year to 240,000, 99.8 percent of the complaints came from, yes, the PTC, according to Mediaweek.
<br />
<br />The trade paper also confirmed an earlier report by media critic Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com that the FCC had received just 90 complaints from 23 individuals about Fox's 'Married by America' before proposing a nearly $1.2 million fine."

<br />It's always nice when a fringe group is able to control the content that the vast majority of the country gets to see/hear.  Imagine if the PMRC had been armed with email... chilling.
