<a href="http://www.thepassionofthechrist.com/cinemas/index.html">The Passion of the Christ</a> is out February 25th.  I'm hoping to see it on opening night and watch the riots.  I've read recently that it's pretty boring, and that has made me think twice about seeing it.  Although it's also been called anti-Semitic, 'as it was', moving, and inflammatory... so who the Hell knows what reality holds.
