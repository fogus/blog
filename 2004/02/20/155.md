I broke my <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> install yesterday by installing the Perl libwww module.  Apparently, doing this installs a file called /usr/bin/HEAD overwriting /usr/bin/head.  Why is this a problem?  Apple OSX uses the HFS+ file system which is case-insensitive.  Therefore, running the command HEAD is the same as head, except that HEAD does not have the same functionality, thus breaking Fink (and other, yet-to-be-determined scripts).  Sigh.  I've been extremely happy with Panther since I've gotten it, but I absolutely hate case-insensitive file systems.  
<br />
<br />Does anyone have a Darwin Kernel 7.2.0 version of /usr/bin/head that they can send me?  
<br />
<br /><i>Update:  I received a slew of head over night... in my inbox (that joke was waaaayy too obvious).  Thank you everone that hooked me up.  All is well with Fink.</i>
