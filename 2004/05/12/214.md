<br />I used to play a game with my friends where they would give me a random phrase, and I would draw a picture to it (<a href="http://blog.founddrama.net">Rob</a> has played this game in the past).  I often wondered what would occur if a group of people were given a seemingly meaningless phrase as the title of an unwritten picture.  I would imagine that the range of ideas would be interesting; as long as the phrase was not apt to conjure stereotypical images.  It might be fun to try one day.
