<br />Perhaps it is my own narrow view of current events, but it appears to me that when news organizations mention the name Al-Sadr, it is almost always qualified with the term 'radical'.  While <img src="http://www.hollandsentinel.com/images/072703/iraqshiite.jpg" align="right" alt="The bitchin' cleric"> there is little doubt that the man is indeed quite radical, it strikes me as odd that news factories all over the world would almost universally use such a term.  Everyone seems to be in on the same terminology in this respect.  It's almost like the craze in 6th grade that almost every pre-teen found in the phrase 'cowinkidink', but I digress.  Do a search at <a hef="http://news.yahoo.com">Yahoo news</a> and you'll find a wide range of sources spouting the 'radical' line.  Why is this?  CNN, The Leesville Leader, The San Francisco Chronicle, CBC, AP, Washington Times, etc....  It's almost universal.  In fact, any time that ANY (well, almost any) news organization refers to any terroristic Muslim leader, they are referred to as radical clerics.  I once had a radical cleric named Karas (18 WIS, 16 INT == radical) when I played DND in high school, but I think the definitions do not match in that case.  So I ask my question again... why?  Let me throw out a few scenarios:
<br />
<br />1) There is a concerted effort to paint these individuals as freaks, and not representative of the Muslim community as a whole.
<br />2) The one dude who controlling all of the media decided that it sounded cool.
<br />3) There is a concerted effort to warn radical clerics to watch their asses.
<br />4) My scope of the matter is extremely limited (i.e. small n).
