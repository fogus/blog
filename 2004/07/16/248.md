<b>Twilight of... er... Dusk of... er... DÃ¤mmerung of ... er... Land of the Dead</b>
<br />  
<br />  George Romero appears to have finally received financial backing for the 4th installment of his NOTLD zombie series.  After a ~20 year hiatis from the genre, <a href="http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2523">he states</a> that filming may begin in October!  Fans of Romero's zombie films have been encouraged by the recent successes of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/">28 Days Later</a> (although not a zombie film) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363547/">Dawn of the Dead 2004</a> (a loose remake of Romero's 2nd installment in the zombie series).  However, this movie has been funded and unfunded may times over, so the reality of <b>Land of the Dead</b> is still very sketchy.
