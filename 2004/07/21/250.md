<b>Ukiyo-e</b>
<br /> 
<br /> For a housewarming gift, Yuki's uncle sent us a couple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e">Ukiyo-e</a> wood block prints by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshige">Ando Hiroshige</a> (very early prints -- holy crap).  I am currently trying to track down the precise titles of the prints and will eventually provide a few pictures (I'm currently wading through the 5000+ prints that he created).  In the meantime I plan on obsessing over them and studying the genre to its fullest before my semester starts.
