<b>Doctor Who?</b>
<br /> 
<br /> Doctor Who is making a comeback on BBC television and the kind folks over at <a href="http://www.gallifreyone.com/newstv.php">Gallfrey One</a> have been stalking the sets and snapping photos of the shoots.  The newest incarnation of the Doctor will be played by <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0001172/">Christopher Eccleston</a> from <i>28 Days Later</i> (the mad military leader) and <i>The Others</i> (the husband) fame.  I am pretty psyched about the new series having almost come full <img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/gallery/monsters1/images/340/sensorites.jpg" align="right" /> circle with the past episodes (I'm slowly working my way through the 1st Doctor, and then should be done).  Doctor Who holds a special place in my heart as it was the only interesting show on (besides Red Dwarf) at 2am.  During high school I would often sneak out of the house with my friends to SK8, and was able to catch the episodes when I returned.  When did I sleep you ask?  In class of course.  Anyway, after I graduated I decided not to go directly to college, but instead chose to try and make my way in the real world.  As it turns out, the real world sucks and I quickly learned that the lala land that is college was the place for me.  In retrospect, the only real advantage of taking that year off was that I managed to see the entire run of <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0048982/">Tom Baker</a> episodes during that time.  Everything else was a wash.
