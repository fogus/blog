I'm almost through my Knowledge Engineering final paper entitled, "Self-Educating Expert Systems".  I've weaved my way all the way from the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics, to Descartes, through Claude Shannon, into Version Spaces, over Go, and finally ending on Pacman.  It's been a long crazy ride.  The paper and perhaps the resulting API will become available someday; perhaps sooner to those asking nicely.

<br />Helmet, Turned Out
<br />Nine Inch Nails, Ruiner
<br />The Cure, Fire in Cairo (eff eye are eee eye en see aye eye are ohh -- with a British twang)
<br />Steel Pulse, Earth Crisis
