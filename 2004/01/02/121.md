<b>In Brief</b>
<br />1) <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html">Paul Graham</a> hits another homerun.
<br />
<br />2) I am thinking about pursuing a degree in history or philosophy (I started on my way at SMCM, but did not continue the full course... opting for CS instead) after I am done with my MS in CS.  
<br />
<br />3) I just closed the "Did you vote in the last presidential election" poll, and to summarize:
<br />WE'RE DOOMED!
<br />
<br />4) Yuki got me "The Graduate" on DVD... one of the top 5 movies of all time IMO.
<br />
<br />5) Props to <a href="http://users.adelphia.net/~friesel/blog/blogmain.html">F_D</a> for posting 101.  
<br />
<br />6) I hope that everyone had a great holiday season.
<br />
<br />7) I have started the annoying process of house hunting... 
<br />
<br />8) I just got outbid at the last moment for Aegpyt... I'm pissed.
<br />
<br />9) "The Art of Unix programming" can be found <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/">online</a>.
<br />
<br />10) <a href="http://www.charm.net/~pete/">Pete</a>: Thanks for the MST3K dupes!  You have motivated me to restart my collection again.
<br />
<br />11) Get 3 years webhosting free... <a href="http://www.1and1.com">1and1.com</a>.  Seems legit.
