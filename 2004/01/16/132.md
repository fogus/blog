I've gotten my kernel to boot finally.  It's is perhaps the most basic kernel that one can create; consisting only of a Grub front-end loading an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a> binary (my kernel) that simply hacks into the VGA memory page, displays a text message, and halts the CPU.  I am using Grub 0.90, NASM 0.98, and GCC 3.2.2 to build and execute in a VmWare virtual machine.  I am in the process of transforming the VGA hack into a more eloquent abstraction such as printk, vsprintnf, and putc.  Likewise, I would prefer to abstract most operations away from the x86 (although all development will occur on it currently), and a video stub is also being coupled with the previously mentioned kernel functions.  Here is a pic:

<br />As you can see, I am writing over the video page and stepping on the toes of Grub's output.  That should be fixed in version 0.011.  More details to come.
