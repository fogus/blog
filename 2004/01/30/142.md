<b>Various Tech News and Misc Ramblings</b>
<br />Today Yuki and I head off to Italy for a well-earned vacation to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02639b.htm">Bologna</a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>.  I plan to delve into hard-core Catholicism while I am there, I just hope that I can avoid being smote (smotten?).  Modus-Ponens will be on vacation as well, but in the meantime occupy yourselves with the following:

Actually there are circa 1992-1994 posts from a Pasadena-based BBS that I was a member of floating around in the ether, but I can't seem to remember the alias that I posted under.  However, I do recall that I liked comp.sys.cbm (I was using my Amiga and C64 back then), alt.guitar.tab (for Misfits and Minor Threat tab), rec.games.frp.dnd, and rec.arts.comics.misc (for Cerebus, Alpha Flight, and Excalibur).
