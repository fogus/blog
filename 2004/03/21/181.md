<img src="./images/dizzy.jpg" align=left>When I first moved to the Northern Virginia area I lived with my friend Matt.  Matt and I have been in bands together since 9th grade and have easily written, played, or covered more than 100 songs in that time.  Soon after moving to Reston we hooked up with a band called Dizzy Dizzy, played a few shows, acted like drunken fools on stage, and promptly got kicked out of Dizzy Dizzy.  Soon after that we hooked up with a couple guys in DC named Brad and Laurent and started a psuedo-band named Homeless Revolution (I think Matt still owns the domain name).  We had a few shows lined up, and made a few tunes worthy of the underground (waaaaay underground) DC punk scene, but broke up after after about 5 practices we broke up because Brad and Laurent couldn't stand Matt.  With the help of iMovie, N-Track, a DVR, and a ton of contrast, we whipped together a Helmet-esque video (visually) in a matter of hours.
