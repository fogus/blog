Meanwhile, over at <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/btl/CustomPoster.aspx?type=color">GeorgeWBush.com</a>...
<br />Some fine individuals decided to put a 2004 campaign poster generator on their site and I decided to help out by generating some Modus Ponens sanctioned flyers.  In PDF format.

<br />[<a href="../files/bush-jesus.pdf">Jesus</a>] [<a href="../files/bush-nuthin.pdf">Future</a>] [<a href="../files/bush-belongs.pdf">Education</a>] [<a href="../files/bush-curse.pdf">Morality</a>] [<a href="../files/bush-ordained.pdf">War Against Terror</a>] [<a href="../files/bush-pee.pdf">Kerry</a>]
