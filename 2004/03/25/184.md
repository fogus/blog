The learning project and house-stuff is taking most of my available time currently, so the blog is falling into disuse.  Pictures of the new house (with the current owners) will be available soon.  Speaking of... Yuki and I had the house inspection yesterday and it went pretty well.  We did find out that the plumbing is some crazy plastic that will probably have to be replaced... CHA-CHING!  Other than that, the house is in good shape, and was "a good deal" according to the inspector.  When we first started this process I floated the idea of finding a home built on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/">a cemetery</a>, previously housing some sort of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078767/">mass murder</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084739/">cult</a>, and/or built on top of (or containing) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082307/">some</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093075/">sort</a> of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093777/">portal</a> in order to save some cash, but she wouldn't have anything to do with that idea for some reason.
