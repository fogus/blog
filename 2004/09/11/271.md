<strong>HiKeeba!</strong>

I've been tinkering around with my old SMCM chess project, Hikeeba, and finally got it working with <a href="http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard.html">Winboard</a> (<a href="http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard/FAQ.html#[B4]">XBoard on OSX</a> next up).  There are some serious flaws with the connection in that when Hikeeba plays black it makes some very boneheaded moves (h8h7 and back again numerous times), however when it plays white it is much stronger (although still quite dumb at times -- as seen in the pictures below).  I have to debug it a bit more to see where the idiocy happens because it is quite strong while running in console mode.
