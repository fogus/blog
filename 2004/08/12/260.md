<b>A Grim Forecast</b>
<br />
<br />If one were to rate the Star Wars series as the typical fan might, then it might be observed that the newest prequels are following a pattern set by the first trilogy. That is, for many fans "A New Hope" was a very good movie but was surpassed by "The Empire Strikes Back" in it grandeur, while "The Return of the Jedi" was the weakest of the three (stupid cutesy Ewoks!). Likewise, "The Phantom Menace" is generally viewed with distaste among fans while "Attack of the Clones" is viewed to be a stronger offering. Based on my own ratings, the chart below paints a dire picture for the forthcoming "Revenge of the Sith". That is, if we assume that the quality plot of the 2nd trilogy follows that of the first, then we can expect a pretty crappy movie indeed (rated < 3.25).
