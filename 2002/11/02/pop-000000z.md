I was amazing to notice how many white vans were out there on the highways and byways.  It was a good thing that they finally caught the Francotirador, else I would have been forced to lead a contingency bent on the forever banishment of white, eggshell, taupe, and bone vans.  Instead, I need only concentrate on the cars with built-in murder-holes.<br/>
