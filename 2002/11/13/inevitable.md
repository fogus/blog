The pinnacle of beauty died with Sedgwick.  The preacher's daughter lives in a well by the side of the road.  The foreman''s son is too busy to speak from popping pills.  I drink when I think of our love and my mother's on the line with a point to her wrist.<BR><BR>I'd brave the black jungle juice and wild head-monkeys that would slaughter my soul to once again feel your atmosphere.<BR>Envelope my soul<BR>My touch<BR>My sight<BR>My tympanic<BR>My stink<BR>My Extra-sensory deception<BR>To feel your mirth in my limbs<BR>I should be so lucky -- you should be so careless.<br/>
