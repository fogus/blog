I'm sitting in the hallway of the historically tasty Johns Hopkins University trying to find the motivation for avoiding a banshee-scream slash flip-out session.  I have become increasingly disillusioned with the higher edumacation realm and its wonderful desire to suck the living fun out of my beautiful beautiful computer science.  Yes sir, I understand that I can effectively get a job but when do we actual make the robots move sir?  Don't get me wrong; I love the prospects of a pool filled with money for to swim in, but could we have a little fun along the way please sir?  I's not that I hate the man, Microsoft, or Gatan himself; I'm just far too lazy to care about yet another Tower of Hanoi.  Perhaps this time we'll put the smallest plate on the bottom?  That'll show 'em.<BR><BR>Anyway, you don't need a weatherman to tell which way the wind blows.<BR>
