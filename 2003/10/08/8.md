So California has elected the Terminator as its Governor.  This fact is raising quite a stir with those outside of CA.  However, if one were to think rationally about this situation, then the logic of the results become clear.  Being a governor is no easy task, so who else is more suited for the job than a single-minded killing machine from the future?  Not only does he already know what's going to happen, but he has that cool info-vision that can flash the latest budget numbers (albeit in COBOL) in his field of vision.  Not to mention his AMD Athlon TX 256-bit (10 GHz FSB) brain (with 64 terrabytes of bubble memory) -- which is perfect for 'crunching the numbers'. I haven't even gotten into the incredible leadership displayed in Kidergarten Cop, and his almost omniscient planning skills shown in both Commando and Predator.  The guy rocks!  If we had only elected a guy like this to the presidency; the war on terrorism would've be in the bag.
