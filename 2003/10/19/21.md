<a href="http://www.linuxant.com/company/press_dldr.php">Linuxant - Company information</a>: "DriverLoader technology is the ideal Linux solution to support devices for which no adequate native open-source drivers are available. It also allows vendors to drastically reduce time to market or eliminate the need to support multiple drivers for Windows and Linux. By using the same driver on both platforms, significant resources can be saved."
