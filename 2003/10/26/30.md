<a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/3574">BeBits - Beyond Magazine</a>: "Beyond is a free magazine in PDF format. It is focused on BeOS and other 'alternative' Operating Systems just like: Linux, AmigaOS, MacOSX, FreeBSD. Beyond is a modern magazine with high quality contents and a stunning graphic layout!"
<br />
<br />If you're itching for some alternative OS action (who isn't I say), then Beyond Magazine is for you.  Before you download; there is absolutely nothing in this zine about Lucio Fulci, although there should be.  I would gladly trade the BeOS articles for some philosophical waxing on <i>Un Gatto Nel Cervello</i>.  That reminds me, I simply cannot bring myself to pay precious coin to see the remake of <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>.  It's bad enough that I feel utterly compelled to digest <i>Freddy vs. Jason</i> (nostalgia ran wild that day my friends), but at least that was a pseudo-sorta-kinda-semi-original script.  Anyone that knew me at SMCM, may remember my homage the TCSM displayed almost proudly on my wall.  In reality, it wasn't there because of its genius nor coherent script, but mainly to hit my straight-laced roommate with a little dose of "shock and awe".  Because of the countless amusing poopy faces given to me from him, the movie will forever hold a certain je ne sais quoi that I <b>will not</b> allow to be tarnished by the Hollywood machine.  Rage!  Rage against the machine!
