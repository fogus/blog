Apple has just released three <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">G4 iBooks</a>.  I have used the iBook G3 in the past and must say that it was perhaps the finest laptop in the business.  The keys tended to be a bit small and the case was often hotter than the sun (imagine the G4 -- ouch), but the durability rocked and the screen was crisp.
