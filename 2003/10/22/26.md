<br />It's about time.  It remains to be seen if this movie displays anti-Semitic views.  However, the hype surrounding it will make Mr. Gibson a very rich(er) man.

A <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ThePassionofChrist-10002071/trailers.php">bootleg trailer</a> has been circulating on the net for a while and actually looks pretty sweet.  Of course, the movie appears to be full of Hollywood peasants.  That is, everyone is a super-model and there isn't a single case of face cancer in the whole trailer.  Next step: resurrection scene score produced by Blink 182.
