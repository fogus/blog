<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Cox">Brad Cox</a>, the inventor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_C_programming_language">Objective C</a> programming language (at the root of NeXTStep, OSX, and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa</a>) has just moved out of my office (we were sharing while he was under contract).  While we spoke often while he worked for <a href="http://www.virtc.com">VTC</a>, I feel a bit bummed that I didn't take advantage of the opportunity to truly pick his brain about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201548348/qid=1066766784/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-7945335-2547845?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">OOP</a> and language theory (although I did obtain a few priceless nuggets along the way).  I therefore dedicate this blog entry to a C.S. legend.
