<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/26/toddlers.claim.ap/index.html">2-year-old model and actor who cut his head at a playground is seeking unspecified lost wages and other compensation from the city.</a>
<br />
<br />Quote: <code>In a letter to officials, she demanded compensation for medical bills, pain and suffering and a "lost wage amount due to his inability to audition or take modeling or commercial jobs while his head heals."</code>
<br />
<br />Further: <code>Mader blamed the boy's injury on a green railing, which she said blends in with the landscaping. Mader said the railing should be painted a brighter color.</code>

<br />Am I unique in that as a child I was constantly pummled by my local park?  There were many times that I was unable to work at my jobs at the coal mine and sweatshop because of a serious, park-relate, injury.  Did I sue the city?  Nooooo!  This is another sign of creeping doom upon the USA.  If this boy model and his mother wins their lawsuit, then I am moving to another country.  Nuff said.
