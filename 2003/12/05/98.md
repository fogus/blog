<br />Alejandro Jodorowsky, a true original in the realm of surreal cinema, is coming back. After much time spent pursuing other projects not related to film, he is about to re-emerge with two gangster films that promise to be unlike any you have ever seen.
<br />
<br />“One is called KINGSHOT, and I call it with humor a metaphysical spaghetti gangster film,” laughs Jodorowsky, who is writing both projects. “I like a lot of spaghetti Westerns. I want to shoot in Italy, with the gangsters speaking Italian.” Jodorowsky reflects on his ideas for the film with a mischievous grin on his face, like a kid about to launch a brilliant practical joke. “It is very weird. All of my pictures are weird. But it is artistic!”
<br />
<br />Working once again with Italian producer Claudio (PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) Argento, with whom he collaborated on 1989’s surreal, violent fantasy SANTA SANGRE (pictured on our front page), Jodorowsky plans to take a different approach with each of the two films. “I will make one for the people who are waiting for a Jodorowsky picture,” the director says. “The young people are going to be expecting art, so I will make one that is pure ‘Jodorowsky.’ Once I finish that, I’ll start the other, which is a Jodorowsky picture but normal. The second picture is called TRYPTYCH; it is also a gangster movie, but for older people. I want to make pictures for older audiences, too. So the young people will have the art, but I will make a historical gangster picture for the others.“
<br />
<br />While they await these new films, the director’s fans will be happy to know that Jodorowsky has completed a commentary track for a European DVD release of SANTA SANGRE. “I enjoyed that very much,” he says. A true raconteur, Jodorowsky spins compelling yarns about his experiences on his magical films. For example, the story of how Guy Stockwell came to be cast as El Gran Orgo, SANTA SANGRE’s doomed circus owner: “I needed a big guy, because the tattooed lady was 6 feet tall! He was drinking two bottles of whiskey a day. He was a beast! He hated me, and I was glad, because I used that,” he laughs. “It was 4:00 one morning, and it was cold and he needed to be naked, so I made him drink two bottles of tequila! He was perfect when he did that!”
<br />
<br />An eagerly awaited American DVD release of SANTA SANGRE should follow the Euro disc, but the director is still uncertain about the prospects for U.S. discs of the still-available but much-bootlegged titles EL TOPO and THE HOLY MOUNTAIN. “I don’t know, because I am still fighting with [financier] Alan Klein,” says Jodorowsky with regret and bemusement; Klein bought the Stateside rights to the films on the advice of John Lennon, and has kept them under wraps ever since. “He’s asking me for money. Not to give me the pictures, but to punish me because of what I did! He doesn’t want to show it, so I took the negative and all the materials, gave them to the pirates and said, ‘Do whatever you want!’ ”
<br />
<br />One project that would have put Jodorowsky back in front of the camera was Jess Franco’s KILLER BARBYS VS. FRANKENSTEIN. “He proposed for me to play Dr. Frankenstein, and I said yes!” Jodorowsky reveals. “I was really happy to do it, but he never called me. I would like to do a Franco picture, because it would be funny!”
<br />
<br />Writing comic books like THE INCAL and SON OF THE GUN for Humanoids Publishing has kept Jodorowsky busy in recent years. “It’s a different pleasure,” he says. “Movies are one pleasure and comics are another. A novel is yet another. It’s different, and I don’t compare [forms of] art. Comics are a noble medium because there is mobility. You can go wherever you want.”

<br />I absolutely adore Jodorowsky's work.  During my SMCM days I made it a personal mission to obtain copies of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067866/">El Topo</a> (my fav), <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0098253/">Santa Sangre</a>, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0071615/">Holy Mountain</a>, and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0061643/">Fando y Lis</a>.  Lately, my Jodorowsky fix has been filled with the likes of <a href="http://www.humanoids-publishing.com/products/prod.php?id=15">The Metabarons</a> (awesome sci-fi with an insane idea on every page), <a href="http://www.humanoids-publishing.com/products/prod.php?id=20">The Incal</a> rereleases, and <a href="http://www.humanoids-publishing.com/products/prod.php?id=55">The White Lama</a>.  I highly recommend checking out his work in all mediums (although the films are a bitch to find).
