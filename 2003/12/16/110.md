I just wasted 3+ days reading <i>Intensity</i> by Dean Koontz.  I feel dirty.  Luckily I only wasted $0.50 on it at the library's junk pile. Have you ever had one of those books that you didn't want to read, but your momentum was simply too strong to stop, so you simply skip every other word just to get the general gist of things?
