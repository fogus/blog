Now that my semester is over, I am looking for something interesting to do and share with the world (via this blog).  Any ideas?  Computer related would be prefered of course.  My thoughts:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.python.org" target="viewer">Python</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/tom/nachos/" target="viewer">Operating System</a> Dev (basic kernel development)
<br />Intense (well, some anyway) research on the <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/DevelopWithAMD/0,,30_2252_875_7044,00.html" target="viewer">AMD64</a> architecture
<br />Build a <a href="http://groups.msn.com/_Secure/0TgDVAlgXOZQ!l34mfZINot5slAApOZfjQSd0AWZ8he9qy5sc6hiRmBeXkfs!De3alL6lJX8my5QBejgddhk1j1jqPoHKLT6MniR7yRG2c9Y!VOpfqJxBOg/elf.jpg" target="viewer">computer</a> (not talking barebones kit here -- the real thing)
<br />Invent a CPU (more like a microprocessor)
<br />An improved (relatively) <a href="http://www.modus-ponens.com" target="viewer">chess engine</a>
<br />Invent a <a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/" target="viewer">programming language</a> (I currently have no domain and may have to invent one)
<br />Bayesian <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html">Spam Filter</a>
<br />
<br />I'm leaning toward the OS and Bayesian routes, but for the next few days I am going to chill and decide on a project next week.
