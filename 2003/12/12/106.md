<br />Longhorn: 2008.  Reserve your copies today.  Oddly enough, regardless of the release date, there are already 12 security patches to download and upwards of 1500 viruses that target it.  
<br />
<br />It will be interesting to see how the industry unfolds between now and 2008.  Linux will be desktop friendly.  Mac OS Z will be released.  And BSD will still be dying.
