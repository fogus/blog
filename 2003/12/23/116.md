As I mentioned previously, one of my fall-break projects will be a Bayesian spam filter (written in Perl).  My initial research starts with Mr. Paul Graham, a major player on the Lisp advocacy front, and bayesian spam guru.  Specifically, the basis for my filter will be rooted in the following:
<br /><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">A Plan for Spam</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html">Better Bayesian Filtering</a>
<br /><a href="http://spamarchive.org/">SpamArchive.org</a>
<br />
<br />My motivation is two-fold:
<br />1) Strengthen my Perl skillz
<br />2) Create a better filter than the one I'm using (<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Apple Mail</a>).
<br />
<br />If the urge hits you then go ahead and read the articles and send your observations/suggestions along to me.
