<br />I have a difficult time sympathizing with robbers and potential rapists.  I'm of the opinion that if you have the gall to break into a person's house or place of business, rob them, hold them against their will, and threaten bodily harm, then you deserve whatever punishment said person can inflict upon you.  Am I crazy?
