<a href="http:/www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=135">Thomas More Law Center</a>: "At issue in the federal lawsuit filed last year by the Thomas More Law Center, a national public interest law firm based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is New Yorkâ€™s policy on religious displays, which prohibits public school displays of Christmas Nativity scenes, while at the same time encouraging the display of the Jewish Menorah and the Islamic star and crescent during their respective holidays."

<br />I am certainly not a religious man, but something about this story does not sit right with me.  While choosing to hold an agnostic stance in my own life, I certainly encourage others to follow their hearts and practice (and deny) any religion that they see fit.  On the surface the NY policies in question smack of Christian persecution.  Am I crazy?
