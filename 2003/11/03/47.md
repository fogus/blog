<a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1075952,00.html">Ciudad Juarez is known as 'the city of the dead girls'</a>. In 10 years almost 400 women have been murdered in this city on the border between Mexico and El Paso, Texas, and the killings continue. Now a courageous Mexican-American journalist is alleging a group of six businessmen is behind the slaughter. Described as 'untouchables', their wealth puts them above the law. Their motive is said to be blood sport.
