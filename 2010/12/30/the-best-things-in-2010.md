- Empty the "Still haven't read..." list
- Noodle through another book[^writing]
- Pescetarianism
- More hammock time

See you next year.

[^writing]: *Everybody does have a book in them, but in most cases that’s where it should stay.*  — Christopher Hitchens

[^sigh]: One side-effect of the book is that I have not had time to bake the other half of many private projects.  It'll be nice to actually have some time to work on code and push it out into the wild... instead of just writing about it.
