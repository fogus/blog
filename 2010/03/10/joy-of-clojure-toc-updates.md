[Chouser](http://blog.n01se.net) and I are working hard to get the material for the upcoming (next week, covering chapters 1-7) technical review in order.  However, we hope to have an update to the MEAP available sooner rather than later.  However, the <http://joyofclojure.com> site has been updated with the forthcoming table of contents.  The changes can be summarized as:

- Old chapter 1 goes to front matter
- Old chapter 2 is new chapter 1, merged with an intro section
- Everything else moves down a chapter number
- Chapter 7 (Macros) gets more material
- Chapter 10 (Concurrency) will discuss cells
- Part contents rearranged a bit
- Plus some other stuff (ooooo, exciting)

:m
