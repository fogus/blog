[Now available for purchase!](http://joyofclojure.com/buy)

Some of you may already know this, but for those unaware I have teamed up with [Chris Houser](http://blog.n01se.net) to write a Clojure book for [Manning Publishing](http://www.manning.com).  The precise details of how this came about are too numerous to recount here and in all likelihood would just work to bore you.  The book **The Joy of Clojure** will be intended as the *next* book on Clojure, delving not only into the how, but also **the why of Clojure**.

Working with Chouser has been awe-inspiring and humbling as the guy solves complex Clojure problems in his sleep.  He is without question, the best possible co-author that I could have.  We will talk more about the book as time passes and as time allows.  Aside from the content of the book, we've been hacking together a pretty cool set of writer workflow tools rooted in a basterdized version of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using Clojure.  We will likely open source that code one day.

In the meantime, more information for [The Joy of Clojure](http://joyofclojure.com/) can be found[^toc] on the official website.  We now have an early access (MEAP) version available on [Manning's "Joy of Clojure"](http://joyofclojure.com/buy) page.  If you decide to purchase please consider sending us feedback -- any and all is welcome.
