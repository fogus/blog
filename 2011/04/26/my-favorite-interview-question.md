Whenever I interview a candidate I always work in some variation of a very simple question:

> How would you change your favorite programming 
> language to make it better?

I don't really care what the answer is (that is, I don't mind if we disagree).  However, I care very much that people think critically about the tools that they use and love.  You would be surprise how many people are stymied by this question.

:F
