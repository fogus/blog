I've been thinking lately how useful it is to classify Clojure as "a Lisp".  I suppose doing so provides a basis for minimal information: macros and uh.... parentheses.  The problem is that neither is unique to, nor emblematic of the Lisp family of languages.  Lisp is the only family of language that is tied so strongly with its variants.  It's now strange to me that I would have had no problem saying "Clojure is my favorite Lisp", but would never think to say any of:

- Ruby is my favorite Smalltalk
- C is my favorite ALGOL
- Mozart is my favorite Prolog
- Haskell is my favorite KRC
- Scala is my favorite OCaml
- Factor is my favorite Forth
- Io is my favorite Self

These types of classifications appear silly to me.  So what makes Lisp different?

:f
