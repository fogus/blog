[Ola Bini](https://olabini.se) has been [arrested](https://heavy.com/news/2019/04/ola-bini/) by the Ecuadorian Police based on questionable links to [Julian Assange and Wikileaks](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2019/04/11/nota/7279946/jackers-rusos-miembro-wikileaks-viven-ecuador-denuncia-maria-paula). Although he has been arrested, [no charges](https://www.fresnobee.com/news/nation-world/world/article229326519.html) against him have yet been filed.

Near to the time of Ola's arrest the Ecuadorian police tweeted an obscured photo of a person in detention and that person's personal belongings, including nearly 20 laptops, numerous drives, and 12 books.

The original tweet read:

> APREHENDIDO ciudadano en #Quito, que mediante la utilización 
> de plataformas digitales de redes sociales, transmitía contenido 
> de connotación social (divulgación de información) a través de 
> sitios web, entre los mas destacados #WikiLeaks. El sujeto 
> utilizaba perfiles falsos. 

A rough translation is as follows:

> Citizen Apprehended in #Quito, who through the use of social 
> networks, transmitted content of social connotation (dissemination 
> of information) through websites, including most prominently WikiLeaks.

That tweet has since been deleted. It is not 100% certain if Ola is the "citizen" in question, but I find the images of the belongings particularly compelling.[^pic]  I had the good fortune of meeting and talking with Ola on numerous occasions and found him a deep thinker who was a true lover of knowledge and intellectually engaged with matters of computing thoughtfully and eloquently. Therefore, as a lover of knowledge myself I dug in on the image above to identify the books procured as so-called evidence.[^ev]

*Update: [Ola released an official statement](https://freeolabini.org/en/statement-from-ola/). In this statement, Ola says something troubling, specifically, "the case against me is based on the books I've read and the technology I have."*

[^ev]: It's unclear what these items might be evidence of, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better way to drum up FUD than to splay those items out in such a manner as the image above shows -- a Guy Fawkes mask would have been a bit too much.

[^pic]: While the obscured face does hint at Ola, the books are the give-away.

I've always been a proponent in the idea that to know someone is to read what they read. Therefore, I'm digging into Ola's books[^ob] to learn a little more about him and the topics and problems that have grown in importance during troubling times.[^tw]

[^tw]: To wit, knowledge is power.

[^ob]: My awareness of most of these books originally came about by learning that [Ola was reading them](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/932658.Ola_Bini).
